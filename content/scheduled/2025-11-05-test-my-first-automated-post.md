# TEST - My First Automated Post

## Hook: What Happened and Why It Matters

This is a test post to verify that the Eastbound automation system is working correctly. If you're reading this on Substack, it means the email publishing worked perfectly! This test validates that GitHub Actions can create drafts, send them to Substack via email, and manage the content workflow automatically.

## The Russian Perspective

This is test content to ensure the automation properly handles the full article structure. In a real post, this section would present the Russian official narrative and commentary from multiple sources like TASS, RIA Novosti, and Kommersant. For testing purposes, we're just verifying that the formatting and content structure are preserved during the automated publishing process.

**Key Sources:**
- Test Source 1: Example Russian media outlet with sample quote
- Test Source 2: Another example source demonstrating proper formatting
- Test Source 3: Third source showing the template structure works

## Context That Western Audiences Miss

In a real analysis, this section would provide cultural, historical, or political context that Western media typically doesn't include. For this test, we're validating that multi-paragraph sections are properly formatted and that the automation preserves the document structure when sending to Substack.

## Comparison with Western Coverage

This test section demonstrates how the comparison format works. In production, this would analyze how Western media covers the story differently from Russian sources.

**Western Coverage:**
- Example Source 1: Test framing
- Example Source 2: Another test framing

**Key Differences:**
- Test difference highlighting formatting preservation
- Another test difference to verify structure

## Implications

What does this mean for:

**Policy:** This test verifies that the policy implications section formats correctly in the automated workflow.

**Business:** Testing that business analysis sections are properly preserved during email-based publishing.

**Culture/Society:** Confirming that cultural analysis maintains proper formatting through the automation pipeline.

## Bottom Line

This test post confirms the automation is working! If this appears in your Substack drafts, the GitHub Actions workflow successfully created the draft, sent it via email using Gmail SMTP, and the content formatting was preserved. The system is ready for real posts.
