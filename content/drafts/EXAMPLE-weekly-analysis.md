# EXAMPLE: How to Structure a Weekly Analysis Post

**NOTE:** This is an example file showing proper structure. Delete this file before going live.

## Hook: What Happened and Why It Matters

Start with the most important development in 2-3 sentences. Why should readers care? What's at stake? Make this compelling and clear.

Example: "Russia's State Duma passed a controversial new law this week that Western media framed as 'crackdown on dissent.' But Russian sources tell a different story—one that reveals deeper tensions about national security versus individual freedoms that most Western coverage completely misses."

## The Russian Perspective

Present the Russian official narrative and commentary from multiple sources. Quote directly when useful. What are Russian media saying? What is the government line? What are independent Russian voices saying?

**This section should be 300-400 words with specific sources and quotes.**

**Key Sources:**
- **TASS:** "Government officials described the legislation as necessary for..."
- **Kommersant:** "Business leaders expressed concern about..."
- **Telegram Channel @[name]:** "Independent analysts noted that..."

Include actual quotes, dates, and specific framing. Don't summarize vaguely—be specific.

## Context That Western Audiences Miss

Provide cultural, historical, or political context that Western media typically doesn't include. What background information is needed to understand Russian actions/reactions? What are the domestic political considerations?

**This section should be 300-400 words explaining:**
- Historical precedent
- Domestic political dynamics
- Cultural factors
- Legal context
- Economic considerations
- Public opinion in Russia

## Comparison with Western Coverage

How is Western media covering this differently? What nuances or perspectives are missing? Where is there agreement or divergence?

**This section should be 200-300 words.**

**Western Coverage:**
- **New York Times:** [How they framed it]
- **BBC:** [Their key angle]
- **Reuters:** [What they emphasized]

**Key Differences:**
- Western media emphasized X, while Russian sources focused on Y
- Missing context: [What Western coverage left out]
- Common ground: [Where both agree]

## Implications

What does this mean for:

**Policy:** How might this affect international relations, sanctions, diplomacy? What should policymakers understand about this development?

**Business:** What are the economic implications? Effects on markets, trade, energy? Risks or opportunities for companies operating in or with Russia?

**Culture/Society:** What does this reveal about Russian society, politics, or culture? How does the Russian public view this? What does it tell us about the direction Russia is heading?

## Bottom Line

Final takeaway in 2-3 sentences. What's the most important thing readers should remember?

Example: "While Western media portrays this as simple authoritarianism, the Russian perspective reveals a more complex debate about security, sovereignty, and the role of foreign influence. Understanding both narratives doesn't mean accepting either—but it's essential for anyone trying to navigate US-Russia relations or operate in the region."
