### Your Generated Charts

**License**: You own copyright

**Recommendation**: Release under MIT License (same as your code)

**Attribution in posts:**
```markdown
*Chart generated by Eastbound Reports using data from [sources]*
```

---

### Article Thumbnails (Use Sparingly!)

**Legal status**: ⚠️ **COMPLICATED**

**The problem:**
- News sites own copyright to their images
- Using them without permission is technically copyright infringement
- **Exception**: Fair Use doctrine (US law)

**Fair Use applies when:**
1. ✅ You're commenting on/critiquing the specific article
2. ✅ You're using it for news reporting/analysis
3. ✅ You're using a small thumbnail, not full-size
4. ✅ You're not competing with the original source
5. ✅ It's transformative (adding analysis/context)

**Recommendation for Eastbound Reports:**

**DO**:
- Use article thumbnails ONLY when directly analyzing that specific article
- Include attribution and link to original
- Use small thumbnails, not full-size images
- Add substantial analysis/commentary

**DON'T**:
- Use article images as generic "Ukraine war" stock photos
- Use images without linking to original article
- Use large/high-res versions
- Use images from articles you're not discussing

**Attribution format:**
```markdown
*Image from [Article Title] at [Source Name]. Used under Fair Use for news analysis.*
[Link to original article]
```

---

## Automated Attribution System

Your `fetch_images.py` already tracks attribution! Here's how to use it:

```python
from fetch_images import fetch_unsplash_image, get_image_attribution

# Fetch image
img_path = fetch_unsplash_image('kremlin moscow', 'images/')

# Get attribution
attribution = get_image_attribution(img_path)
print(attribution)
# Output: "Photo by Jane Doe on Unsplash"
```

All fetched images are stored in `images/cache/image_metadata.json` with:
- Source URL
- Photographer/creator name
- Attribution text
- License type
- Original URL

---

## Best Practices for Eastbound Reports

### For Generic Topic Images

**Use Unsplash**:
```python
from fetch_images import fetch_unsplash_image

# Generic topics
fetch_unsplash_image('kremlin russia', 'images/')
fetch_unsplash_image('ukraine conflict', 'images/')
fetch_unsplash_image('moscow cityscape', 'images/')
```

**Pros:**
- 100% legal, zero risk
- High-quality professional photos
- No attribution required
- Unlimited usage

**Cons:**
- Not specific news images
- May feel generic/stock-photo-ish

---

### For Specific People/Places

**Use Wikipedia**:
```python
from fetch_images import fetch_wikipedia_image

# Specific entities
fetch_wikipedia_image('Vladimir Putin', 'images/')
fetch_wikipedia_image('Kremlin', 'images/')
fetch_wikipedia_image('Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'images/')
```

**Pros:**
- 100% legal
- Specific, recognizable images
- Educational context
- Free to use

**Cons:**
- May be older/dated photos
- Limited selection

---

### For Specific News Events

**Use with extreme caution**:
```python
from fetch_images import fetch_article_thumbnail

# ONLY if you're analyzing this specific article
article_url = "https://tass.com/politics/1234567"
img = fetch_article_thumbnail(article_url, 'images/')

# MUST include in your post:
# - Link to original article
# - Discussion of that specific article
# - Fair use statement
```

**Pros:**
- Specific to the news event
- Timely and relevant

**Cons:**
- **LEGAL RISK** if not used correctly
- Only valid under fair use
- Must be tied to specific article analysis

---

## Integration with Your Workflow

### Add Attribution to Posts

When `generate_ai_draft.py` includes images, add attribution:

```markdown
![Kremlin](/images/kremlin-abc123.jpg)
*Photo by Ivan Petrov on Unsplash*

Analysis of Russian media coverage...
```

### Automated Attribution Injection

Create a helper script:

```python
# scripts/add_image_attributions.py

from pathlib import Path
from fetch_images import get_image_attribution
import re

def add_attributions_to_post(post_path):
    """Add attribution lines under images in markdown post."""

    with open(post_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Find all image references
    images = re.findall(r'!\[.*?\]\((.*?)\)', content)

    for img_path in images:
        # Get attribution
        attribution = get_image_attribution(Path(img_path))

        if attribution:
            # Add attribution line after image
            old = f'![...]({img_path})'
            new = f'{old}\n*{attribution}*\n'
            content = content.replace(old, new)

    # Save updated content
    with open(post_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(content)
```
