## Project Overview

Eastbound is a Russian media analysis and translation service providing English-speaking audiences with accurate translations, context, and analysis of Russian media sources. This is a business/media project, NOT an intelligence operation.

## Core Principles (CRITICAL)

**Safety & Independence:**
- Everything published is public and transparent
- Completely independent from all governments
- Only analyze publicly available, open-source information
- Frame as journalism/research, NOT intelligence analysis
- Analyze perspectives from both Russian and American viewpoints

**Content Guidelines:**
- Translate accurately and provide cultural/political context
- Report objectively without taking partisan positions
- Acknowledge biases in sources
- Maintain professional, academic tone
- Never work with intelligence agencies or handle classified information
