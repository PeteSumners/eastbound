  "summary": "Wagner Group is a Russian private military company (PMC) founded ~2014, closely tied to Russian military intelligence (GRU). Led by Yevgeny Prigozhin (1961-2023), nicknamed 'Putin's chef' due to catering business. Wagner operated in Ukraine (2014+), Syria, Africa, with plausible deniability for Kremlin. Prigozhin launched failed mutiny against Russian military leadership June 2023, then died in suspicious plane crash August 2023.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "For years, Russia officially denied Wagner's existence or connection to government. Called it 'private company' with no state ties. After 2022 invasion, acknowledged Wagner but minimized official connections. After mutiny, vilified Prigozhin as traitor who was deceived by enemies. After his death, praised his earlier contributions while condemning rebellion.",

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Wagner is Russian state proxy force providing plausible deniability for military operations Kremlin wants to conceal. Funded by Russian state, directed by GRU intelligence, used for deniable operations and exploiting resources in Africa. Guilty of war crimes in Syria, Africa, Ukraine. Prigozhin was oligarch enriched by Putin, fell out over Ukraine failures. His mutiny revealed cracks in Putin's system. Death was almost certainly ordered by Putin as punishment.",
