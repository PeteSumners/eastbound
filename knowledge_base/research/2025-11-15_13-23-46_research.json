      "summary": "In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.",

      "summary": "Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.",

      "summary": "Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.",

      "title": "Impacts of Decoder Latency on Utility-Scale Quantum Computer Architectures",
      "summary": "The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.",

      "summary": "The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.",

These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional Rényi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general.

In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.",

Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers.

We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.",

      "summary": "Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.",

For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.",

Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels.

We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates. Our cavity-based approach outperforms transmon schemes, providing a practical pathway for distributed superconducting quantum computing.",

      "summary": "As quantum hardware advances toward fault-tolerant operation, an intermediate stage known as early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is emerging, where partial error correction enables meaningful computation. In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications.",

This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.",

Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.",

For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches.",

On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.",

In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\\{\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} Hs}\\}}_{s\\in\\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\\big(\\sqrt{t\\log(1/\\varepsilon)}\\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.",

Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation.

The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity. It is the quantum self-interference induced by the scale of this two-legged GA and the phase difference between the GA-waveguide couplings that tune the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion.",

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes.

We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.\n  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.\n  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.",

Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.",

      "summary": "In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.",

In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.",

However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T-gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. While it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on 5- to 8-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.",

Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, \"tensors of tensors\" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation).

      "summary": "Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T(\\log L + d r \\log K)\\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.",

Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.",

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a \"compression\" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.",

We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $φ^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators.

      "summary": "We present the results of Car-Parrinello (CP) simulations of water at ambient conditions and under pressure, using a rigid molecule approximation. Throughout our calculations, water molecules were maintained at a fixed intramolecular geometry corresponding to the average structure obtained in fully unconstrained simulations. This allows us to use larger time steps than those adopted in ordinary CP simulations of water, and thus to access longer time scales. In the absence of chemical reactions or dissociation effects, these calculations open the way to ab initio simulations of aqueous solutions that require timescales substantially longer than presently feasible (e.g. simulations of hydrophobic solvation). Our results show that structural properties and diffusion coefficients obtained with a rigid model are in better agreement with experiment than those determined with fully flexible simulations. Possible reasons responsible for this improved agreement are discussed.",

This theory assumes that the probability distribution of the returns of the underlying asset is a gaussian distribution. However, it is observed in the market that this hypothesis is flawed, leading to the introduction of a fudge factor, the so-called volatility smile. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore extensions of the Black-Scholes theory to non-gaussian distributions. In this contribution we provide an explicit formula for the price of an option when the distributions of the returns of the underlying asset is parametrized by an Edgeworth expansion, which allows for the introduction of higher independent moments of the probability distribution, namely skewness and kurtosis. We test our formula with options in the brazilian and american markets, showing that the volatility smile can be reduced.

On the other hand the galaxy spatial distribution show complex structures with a high degree of inhomogeneity and fractal-like spatial correlations up to some relevant cosmological scale. The theoretical problem of cosmological structure formation should then explain the growth of strongly correlated and non-linear structures from the very uniform field of density fluctuations given as standard initial condition.",

In all these discussions defects and anti-defects form with equal probabilities. In contrast, many physical situations, such as formation of baryons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at present energies, flux tube formation in superconductors in the presence of external magnetic field, and formation of superfluid vortices in a rotating vessel, require a mechanism which can bias (say) defects over anti-defects. Such a bias can crucially affect defect-anti-defect correlations, apart from its effects on defect density. In this paper we initiate an investigation for the basic mechanism of biased formation of defects. For Skyrmions in 1+1 dimensions, we show that incorporation of a chemical potential term in the effective potential leads to a domain structure where order parameter is spatially varying. We show that this leads to biased formation of Skyrmions.",

We derive the rate equations governing the evolution of the charge density and spin polarization of this system in the Markovian limit in one-particle approximation. If only two-site hopping events are taken into account, the evolution of the charge density and of the spin polarization is found to be decoupled. A critical electric field is found, above which oscillations are superimposed on the temporal decay of the total polarization. A coupling between charge density and spin polarization occurs on the level of three-site hopping events. The coupling terms are identified as the anomalous Hall effect and the recently proposed spin Hall effect. Thus, an unpolarized charge current through a sheet of finite width leads to a transversal spin accumulation in our model system.",

The model self-organises into a dynamic equilibrium with statistical properties that are in close qualitative and in many cases quantitative agreement with a broad range of known empirical distributions of developed capitalism, including the power-law distribution of firm size, the Laplace distribution of firm and GDP growth, the lognormal distribution of firm demises, the exponential distribution of the duration of recessions, the lognormal-Pareto distribution of income, and the gamma-like distribution of the rate-of-profit of firms. Normally these distributions are studied in isolation, but this model unifies and connects them within a single causal framework. In addition, the model generates business cycle phenomena, including fluctuating wage and profit shares in national income about values consistent with empirical studies. A testable consequence of the model is a conjecture that the rate-of-profit distribution is consistent with a parameter-mix of a ratio of normal variates with means and variances that depend on a firm size parameter that is distributed according to a power-law.",

Performing fits of the electric field dependence they came to conclusion that an appreciable contribution to the dielectric permittivity originates from polar clusters. In this Comment we show that the dielectric permittivity at low frequencies (100 Hz -- 1 MHz) equals to that in the THz region, close below the polar phonon response. This excludes the possibility of any appreciable dielectric dispersion due to polar clusters. In addition, we demonstrate that correct treatment using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory allows to fit the electric field dependence of the dielectric constant without assuming any polarization mechanism besides the polar phonon modes.",

Our main finding is that synthetic catalogs generated by the OFC model share practically all properties of real seismicity at a qualitative level, with however significant quantitative differences. We find that OFC catalogs can be in large part described by the concept of triggered seismicity but the properties of foreshocks depend on the mainshock magnitude, in qualitative agreement with the critical earthquake model and in disagreement with simple models of triggered seismicity such as the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model [Ogata, 1988]. Many other features of OFC catalogs can be reproduced with the ETAS model with a weaker clustering than real seismicity, i.e. for a very small average number of triggered earthquakes of first generation per mother-earthquake.",

The model is a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with alternating on-site energies, modelling e.g. an array of optical waveguides with alternating widths. The solution bifurcates from a stationary discrete gap soliton, and in a regime of large oscillations its intensity oscillates periodically between having one peak at the central site, and two symmetric peaks at the neighboring sites with a dip in the middle. Such solutions, termed 'pulsons', are found to exist in continuous families ranging arbitrarily close both to the anticontinuous and continuous limits. Furthermore, it is shown that they may be linearly stable also in a regime of large oscillations.",

We've measured the real $ε_1(ω)$ and imaginary $ε_2(ω)$ parts of the dielectric function, reflectance $R(ω)$ and optical conductivity at room temperature. The shift of the most pronounced spectral features to the high energy region on 0.3 eV associated with larger distortions due to the smaller rare earth ionic radii in HoCoO$_3$ in comparison with LaCoO$_3$ was observed. Also there was found an enhancement of absorption intensity in the range 1.3-2.3 eV in all kinds of spectra in HoCoO$_3$, which can be attributed basing on the results of LDA+U calculations to the different spin-states of Co$^{3+}$ ion in these compounds. The shift of the onset of the absorption from less than 0.1 eV in LaCoO$_3$ to 0.7 eV in HoCoO$_3$ and an absorption intensity enhancement in a narrow spectral range 1.2-2.6 eV in HoCoO$_3$ are clearly seen from the calculated convolution of partial densities of states obtained in the LDA+U approach.

We extrapolate Jc(0) ~ 4 x 10^7 A/cm^2, which is an order of magnitude greater than estimates obtained from magnetization measurements of polycrystalline powders. The field dependence is purely exponential Jc(T,H) = Jc(T) exp(-H/Ho) over the entire field range of 0 to 9 T. The unconventional scaling behavior of the critical current appears rooted in an anomalous temperature dependence of the London penetration depth, suggesting an unusual superconducting ground state in MgCNi3.",

The main aim of the paper is to show that, changing the quantization axis with respect to the common usage, it is possible to prove a general result either for N or the coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model. This completes the analysis, known in the current literature, with respect to the same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity, keeping the density constant. For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by the Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of quantization is defined by the interaction. The relevance of this result relies on the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using electromagnetic interaction and so, one can states that the thermodynamic limit is enough to grant the appearance of classical effects. Indeed, recent experimental results give first evidence that superposition states disappear interacting with an electromagnetic field having a large number of photons.",

While the latter can be understood using rate equation theories (RET), the islanding exponent (connecting the power law growth of island density with growth rate) obtained for the CVD growth is a puzzle, with the CVD exponent being almost twice the MBE exponent. We carry out (2+1) dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo(MC) simulations to study this CVD growth. Hydrogen plays a critical role during growth. Disilane breaks up into hydrides on the Si surface. We use MC simulations to explore a number of cases involving one or two migrating species and show that the large islanding exponent is probably due to the presence of two hydrides, one of which has a much shorter lifetime than the other. We modify RET taking this possibility into account in order to shed light on the experimental observation. We calculate the scaling properties of the island distributions using MC simulations and the modified RET, and conclude that the large effective CVD exponents arise from the failure of the simple island number scaling scenario which no longer applies to the two-component situation prevailing under CVD growth conditions.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.",

      "summary": "Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.",

In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.",

The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.",

Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination.

The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.",

The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision.

Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods.

Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set.

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.",

However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.",

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow.

In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.",

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.",

To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.",

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

      "summary": "One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.",

      "summary": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.",

      "summary": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\\% sensitivity, and 91.9\\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.",

Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.",

Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches.

However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.",

However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.",

      "summary": "Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.",

A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.",

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.",

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.",

However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.",

      "summary": "Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.",

      "summary": "Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.",

      "summary": "Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.",

Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data.

With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.",

We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages.

Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts.

Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.",

To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.",

This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage.

Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs.

To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations.

      "summary": "In several jurisdictions, the regulatory framework on the release and sharing of personal data is being extended to machine learning (ML). The implicit assumption is that disclosing a trained ML model entails a privacy risk for any personal data used in training comparable to directly releasing those data. However, given a trained model, it is necessary to mount a privacy attack to make inferences on the training data. In this concept paper, we examine the main families of privacy attacks against predictive and generative ML, including membership inference attacks (MIAs), property inference attacks, and reconstruction attacks. Our discussion shows that most of these attacks seem less effective in the real world than what a prima face interpretation of the related literature could suggest.",

      "title": "On the Detectability of Active Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning",
      "summary": "One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.",

However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models (GG-CDMs) for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.",

We provide novel insights into their overall security, usability, and automation capabilities and contribute to authentication security research through a better understanding of password update processes. Websites deploy highly diverse, often complex, confusing password update processes and lack the support of password managers. Processes are often hard to use, and end-users can barely transfer experiences and knowledge across websites.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.",

      "summary": "AI programming assistants have demonstrated a tendency to generate code containing basic security vulnerabilities. While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness. These findings highlight the importance of secure training data in improving the reliability of AI-based programming assistants, though further enhancements to model architecture and evaluation are needed to reinforce these outcomes.",

      "summary": "Dataset distillation (DD) compresses large datasets into smaller ones while preserving the performance of models trained on them. Although DD is often assumed to enhance data privacy by aggregating over individual examples, recent studies reveal that standard DD can still leak sensitive information from the original dataset due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees. Existing differentially private (DP)-DD methods attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting noise into the distillation process. However, they often fail to fully leverage the original dataset, resulting in degraded realism and utility. This paper introduces \\libn, a novel framework that addresses the key limitations of current DP-DD by leveraging DP-generated data. Specifically, \\lib initializes the distilled dataset with DP-generated data to enhance realism. Then, generated data refines the DP-feature matching technique to distill the original dataset under a small privacy budget, and trains an expert model to align the distilled examples with their class distribution. Furthermore, we design a privacy budget allocation strategy to determine budget consumption across DP components and provide a theoretical analysis of the overall privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments show that \\lib significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DP-DD methods in terms of both dataset utility and robustness against membership inference attacks, establishing a new paradigm for privacy-preserving dataset distillation.",

      "summary": "The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.",

However, this surge raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive patterns can reveal personal details. While traditional differential privacy (DP) relies on trusted servers, local differential privacy (LDP) enables users to perturb their own data. However, traditional LDP methods perturb time series data by adding user-specific noise but exhibit vulnerabilities. For instance, noise applied within fixed time windows can be canceled during aggregation (e.g., averaging), enabling adversaries to infer individual statistics over time, thereby eroding privacy guarantees.\n  To address these issues, we introduce a Cooperative Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) mechanism that enhances privacy by distributing noise vectors across multiple users. In our approach, noise is collaboratively generated and assigned so that when all users' perturbed data is aggregated, the noise cancels out preserving overall statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. This cooperative strategy not only counters vulnerabilities inherent in time-window-based methods but also scales effectively for large, real-time datasets, striking a better balance between data utility and privacy in multiuser environments.",

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.",

      "summary": "In today's digital world, which has many different types of media, steganography, the art of secret communication, has a lot of problems to deal with. Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to \"weak\" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems.",

This study presents a slice-aware lightweight machine-learning framework for detecting spoofing attacks within 5G network slices.

Two efficient classifiers, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained independently for each slice using statistical flow features derived from mirrored user-plane traffic. Slice-aware training improved detection accuracy by up to 5% and achieved F1-scores between 0.93 and 0.96 while maintaining real-time operation on commodity edge hardware. The results demonstrate that aligning security intelligence with slice boundaries enhances detection reliability and preserves operational isolation, enabling practical deployment in 5G network-security environments. Conceptually, the work bridges network-security architecture and adaptive machine learning by showing that isolation-aware intelligence can achieve scalable, privacy-preserving spoofing defense without high computational cost.",

However, LLMs' effectiveness for phishing detection remains unexplored. This study investigates how to effectively leverage LLMs for phishing detection (including target brand identification) by examining the impact of input modalities (screenshots, logos, HTML, and URLs), temperature settings, and prompt engineering strategies. Using a dataset of 19,131 real-world phishing websites and 243 benign sites, we evaluate seven LLMs -- two commercial models (GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.0 flash) and five open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Janus, DeepSeek-VL2, and R1) -- alongside two deep learning (DL)-based baselines (PhishIntention and Phishpedia).\n  Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples. For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%. However, incorporating multiple input modalities simultaneously or applying one-shot prompts does not consistently enhance performance and may degrade results.

      "summary": "Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.",

In this paper, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that integrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest (RF) to enhance detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). By using CICIDS2017 dataset, the approach begins with comprehensive data preprocessing and narrows down the most significant features via RFE. A Random Forest (RF) model was trained on the refined feature set, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) used to interpret the contribution of each selected feature. Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers.

      "summary": "Key-length extension (KLE) techniques provide a general approach to enhancing the security of block ciphers by using longer keys. There are mainly two classes of KLE techniques, cascade encryption and XOR-cascade encryption. This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.\n  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2κ/3})$ with $O(2^{2κ/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{κ/2})$ with $O(2^κ)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.\n  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(κ+n)/2})$ ($κ$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.\n  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions. We present a general quantum SITM framework for the construction $ELE=E^2\\circ L\\circ E^1$ and provide specific attack schemes for three different forms of the middle layer $L$. The quantum SITM attack technique can be further applied to a broader range of quantum cryptanalysis scenarios.",

To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\\% attack success rate with only 62.4\\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\\% and KL divergence by 41.2\\%.

      "summary": "Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.",

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.",

      "summary": "Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.",

Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.",

However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.",

      "summary": "Ultra-low latency, the hallmark of fifth-generation mobile communications (5G), imposes exacting timing demands on identification as well. Current cryptographic solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which results in heightened identification delays. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identifies devices at the physical layer, blocking impersonation attacks while significantly reducing latency. Unfortunately, multipath channels compromise RFF accuracy, and existing channel-resilient methods demand feedback or processing across multiple time points, incurring extra signaling latency. To address this problem, the paper introduces a new RFF extraction technique that employs signals from multiple receiving antennas to address multipath issues without adding latency. Unlike single-domain methods, the Log-Linear Delta Ratio (LLDR) of co-temporal channel frequency responses (CFRs) from multiple antennas is employed to preserve discriminative RFF features, eliminating multi-time sampling and reducing acquisition time. To overcome the challenge of the reliance on minimal channel variation, the frequency band is segmented into sub-bands, and the LLDR is computed within each sub-band individually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme attains a 96.13% identification accuracy for 30 user equipments (UEs) within a 20-path channel under a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the theoretical latency using the Roofline model, resulting in the air interface latency of 0.491 ms, which satisfies ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) latency requirements.",

The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system.

      "summary": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.",

      "summary": "As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments.",

To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine, directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries.",

      "summary": "Hardware-software leakage contracts have emerged as a formalism for specifying side-channel security guarantees of modern processors, yet verifying that a complex hardware design complies with its contract remains a major challenge. While verification provides strong guarantees, current verification approaches struggle to scale to industrial-sized designs. Conversely, prevalent hardware fuzzing approaches are designed to find functional correctness bugs, but are blind to information leaks like Spectre.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and scalable approach: coverage-guided hardware-software contract fuzzing. Our methodology leverages a self-compositional framework to make information leakage directly observable as microarchitectural state divergence. The core of our contribution is a new, security-oriented coverage metric, Self-Composition Deviation (SCD), which guides the fuzzer to explore execution paths that violate the leakage contract. We implemented this approach and performed an extensive evaluation on two open-source RISC-V cores: the in-order Rocket Core and the complex out-of-order BOOM core. Our results demonstrate that coverage-guided strategies outperform unguided fuzzing and that increased microarchitectural coverage leads to a faster discovery of security vulnerabilities in the BOOM core.",

The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.\n  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google.

      "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines.",

Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models.

The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process show that collective outcomes are best when agents display an intermediate level of rationality; they deliberate enough to respond to risk but remain flexible enough to adapt, avoiding the instability of both random and overly rigid decision-making. Regret exerts a dual influence; moderate levels encourage adaptive self-correction, while excessive regret or greed destabilize choices. Uncertainty has a similarly non-linear effect; moderate ambiguity promotes caution, but too much uncertainty disrupts coordination. Social norms restore cooperation by compensating for incomplete information. Among them, personal norms drive behavior when individuals have clear information and moral confidence; injunctive norms, reflecting perceived approval, gain influence under uncertainty; and descriptive norms, based on observing others' actions, serve as informational cues that guide behavior when direct knowledge is limited. Overall, the model provides a psychologically grounded, computationally explicit account of how emotion, cognition, and social norms govern preventive behavior during epidemics.",

Despite sharing similar scaling laws of population and mobility, cities exhibit vastly different spatial patterns. This paradox call for a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of spatial heterogeneity, while existing qualitative or descriptive studies fail to capture the underlying mechanisms. Here, we propose a coupled dynamical model that describe the intra-city population-mobility coevolution, explaining spatial heterogeneity as an emergent outcome of mutual feedback between the fast-changing mobility and the slow-adapting population. Our model is validated on over 388 million records from eight diverse global cities, successfully reproduces both the statistical laws and realistic spatial patterns. We find out realistic heterogeneity emerges as a distinct stable state, intermediate between disordered homogeneity and unsustainable super-hub dominance. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically show that populated areas are predominantly shaped by coevolution strength, while the increasing distance decay leads cities through a three-phase transition of homogeneity-heterogeneity-homogeneity. Besides, functional attractiveness between areas consistently enhances the ordered heterogeneous structure. Simulations of real-world planning scenarios -- including crisis-induced lockdown, planned zone expansions, and dispersal from congested centers -- indicate that integrated population-mobility policies are more cost-effective than single interventions. Our model can provides mechanistic, high-resolution insights to rigorously inform policy design.",

Nevertheless, it is not necessarily an individual feature, but may also reflect the general state of a local community. Consequently, a person with a high reputation becomes attractive not just because we can expect cooperative acts with higher probability, but also because such a person is involved in a more efficient group venture. These observations highlight the cumulative and socially transmissible nature of reputation. Interestingly, these aspects were completely ignored by previous works. To reveal the possible consequences, we introduce a spatial public goods game in which we use an assimilated reputation simultaneously characterizing the individual and its neighbors' reputation. Furthermore, a reputation-dependent synergy factor is used to capture the high (or low) quality of a specific group. Through extensive numerical simulations, we investigate how cooperation and extended reputation co-evolve, thereby revealing the dynamic influence of the assimilated reputation mechanism on the emergence and persistence of cooperation. By fostering social learning from high-reputation individuals and granting payoff advantages to high-reputation groups via an adaptive multiplier, the assimilated reputation mechanism promotes cooperation, ultimately to the systemic level.",

      "summary": "This report provides insights into global population dynamics since the beginning of the Anthropocene, focusing on empirical data and minimizing a priori the impact of model assumptions. It explores the Relative Growth Rate concept, introduced recently to global population studies by Lehman et al. [PNAS 118, e2024150118 (2021)] and subsequently extended to its analytical counterpart [PLoS ONE 20, eo323165 (2025)]. The analysis reveals a general non-monotonic growth pattern in the Anthropocene, emphasizing the uniqueness of the Industrial Revolution era. For the first 290 years, the Doomsday critical scaling provides a superior description for population changes, with a singularity at 2026. This is followed by the crossover to an exceptional 'reversed criticality' patterm, which has held over the last six decades, to the present day. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the human Real Intelligence (RI) population during the Innovations-driven Industrial Revolution times - a period of rapidly increasing connectivity and complexity - can serve as a model counterpart for the puzzling dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth. The final conclusion is positive: the catastropic Doomsday singularity can be avoided due to the generic system constraints , both for RI and AI.",

      "summary": "This paper introduces a scalable methodology for the objective analysis of quality metrics across six major Italian metropolitan areas: Rome, Bologna, Florence, Milan, Naples, and Palermo. Leveraging georeferenced Street View imagery and an advanced Urban Vision Intelligence system, we systematically classify the visual environment, focusing on key metrics such as the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) and the Façade Degradation Score (FDS). The findings quantify Structural Heterogeneity (Spatial Variance), revealing significant quality dispersion (e.g., Milan $σ^2_{\\mathrm{PCI}}=1.52$), and confirm that the classical Urban Gradient -- quality variation as a function of distance from the core -- is consistently weak across all sampled cities ($R^2 < 0.03$), suggesting a complex, polycentric, and fragmented morphology. In addition, a Cross-Metric Correlation Analysis highlights stable but modest interdependencies among visual dimensions, most notably a consistent positive association between façade quality and greenery ($ρ\\approx 0.35$), demonstrating that structural and contextual urban qualities co-vary in weak yet interpretable ways. Together, these results underscore the diagnostic potential of Vision Intelligence for capturing the integrated spatial and morphological structure of Italian cities and motivate a large national-scale analysis.",

We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.",

      "summary": "The increasing occurrence of natural hazards such as wildfires and drought, along with urban expansion and land consumption, causes increasing levels of fire risk to populations and human settlements. Moreover, increasing geopolitical instability in many regions of the world requires evaluation of scenarios related to potential hazards caused by military operations. Quantitative knowledge on burnable fuels and their spatio-temporal distribution across landscapes is crucial for risk and potential damage assessments. While there is good understanding of the distributions of biomass fuels based on remote sensing observations, the combustible mass of the built environment has rarely been quantified in a spatially explicit manner. Therefore, we developed fine-grained estimates of urban fuels for the conterminous United States, estimating the combustible mass of building materials, building contents, and personal vehicles at 250 m spatial resolution. The resulting dataset is called COMBUST (Combustible mass of the built environment in the conterminous United States) and includes different backcasting scenarios from 1975 to 2020. COMBUST is based on the integration of a variety of geospatial data sources such as Earth-observation derived data, real estate data, statistical estimates and volunteered geographic information. COMBUST is accompanied by COMBUST PLUS, a set of consistently enumerated gridded datasets facilitating combustion exposure modelling of buildings and population. These datasets constitute a rich resource for ecological and social science applications, as well as for disaster risk management and planning-related decision making for U.S. settlements.

We demonstrate that complex, empirically-observed phenomena, such as the concentration of populations in cities and the emergence of power-law wealth distributions, can be derived directly from a microscopic model of agents governed by underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our multi-scale derivation yields the exact mesoscopic fluctuating (Dean-Kawasaki) dynamics and the macroscopic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system of equations. The analytical solution of this system reveals how a heterogeneous resource landscape alone is sufficient to generate the coupled structures of spatial and economic inequality, thus providing a formal link between micro-level stochasticity and macro-level deterministic order.",

      "summary": "Communication of scientific knowledge beyond the walls of science is key to science's societal impact. Media channels play sizable roles in disseminating new scientific ideas about human health, economic welfare, and government policy as well as responses to emergent challenges such as climate change. Indeed, effectively communicating science to the public helps inform society's decisions on scientific and technological policies, the value of science, and investment in research. At the same time, the rise of social media has greatly changed communication systems, which may substantially affect the public's interface with science. Examining 20.9 million scientific publications, we compare research coverage in social media and mainstream media in a broad corpus of scientific work. We find substantial shifts in the scale, impact, and heterogeneity of scientific coverage. First, social media significantly alters what science is, and is not, covered. Whereas mainstream media accentuates eminence in the coverage of science and focuses on specific fields, social media more evenly sample research according to field, institutional rank, journal, and demography, increasing the scale of scientific ideas covered relative to mainstream outlets more than eightfold. Second, despite concerns about the quality of science represented in social media, we find that social media typically covers scientific works that are impactful and novel within science. Third, scientists on social media, as experts in their domains, tend to surface high-impact research in their own fields while sampling widely across research institutions. Contrary to prevalent observations about social media, these findings reveal that social media expands and diversifies science reporting by highlighting high-impact research and bringing a broader array of scholars, institutions and scientific concepts into public view.",

This study compares the modal share in European cities, analysing the differences between those that have a metro, a tram, or neither. The analysis draws on a comprehensive dataset from CitiesMoving.com, which compiles and harmonises mobility surveys from around the world according to the ABC framework (A for Active mobility, B for Bus and other forms of Public Transport, and C for Cars).

      "summary": "This paper investigates the emergence of wealth inequality through a minimalist kinetic exchange model that incorporates two fundamental economic features: fixed-amount transactions and hard budget constraints. In contrast to the maximum entropy principle, which predicts an exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with moderate inequality for unconstrained wealth exchange, we demonstrate that these realistic trading rules drive the system toward a highly unequal steady state. We develop a self-consistent mean-field theory, deriving a master equation where agent income follows a Poisson process coupled to the poverty rate. Numerical solution reveals a stationary distribution characterized by a substantial pauper class, high Gini coefficient, and exponential tail--significantly deviating from the maximum entropy benchmark. Agent-based simulations confirm these findings. We identify the poverty trap as the key mechanism: the liquidity constraint creates asymmetric economic agency, where zero-wealth agents become passive recipients, unable to participate in wealth circulation. This work establishes that substantial inequality can emerge spontaneously from equal-opportunity exchanges under basic economic constraints, without requiring agent heterogeneity or multiplicative advantage, providing a mechanistic foundation for understanding poverty as an emergent property of exchange rules.",

      "summary": "Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.",

Using a major campus consolidation in Trondheim, Norway as a case study, we examine how this framework supports sustainable mobility through integrated analysis of mobility patterns, constraints, and transition impacts. The consolidation eliminates over 1,300 parking spaces while increasing daily population by 9,300 people. We employ a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative survey data (n=573) with quantitative big data analysis of public transit and crowd movement patterns. This integrates three analytical components and provides grounded insights into commuting flows, modes, durations, distances, and congestion points, while addressing the spatiotemporal mobility realities of affected populations. The analysis reveals complex mobility constraints, with 59.3% of respondents having children and private cars dominating in winter (49.4%). Though there is broad support for sustainable mobility goals, 86.0% identify increasing travel duration as primary difficulty. Quantitative analysis highlights peak usage patterns and congestion risks, with seasonal variations. This study demonstrates integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis to anticipate negative impacts and enable efficient sustainable mobility policies. The results inform practical recommendations for data-driven mobility interventions that align sustainability goals with lived realities.",

Public transport systems face this dilemma most acutely: they enable access to jobs, education, and services, yet also facilitate close contact among travelers. We develop an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based epidemic simulation (EpiSim) with an optimization-based public transport flow model under capacity constraints. Using Munich as a case study, we analyze how combinations of facility closures and transport restrictions shape epidemic outcomes and accessibility. The results reveal three key insights. First, epidemic interventions redistribute rather than simply reduce infection risks, shifting transmission to households. Second, epidemic and transport policies interact nonlinearly - moderate demand suppression can offset large capacity cuts. Third, epidemic pressures amplify temporal and spatial inequalities, disproportionately affecting peripheral and peak-hour travelers. These findings highlight that blanket restrictions are both inefficient and inequitable, calling for targeted, time- and space-differentiated measures to build epidemic-resilient and socially fair transport systems.",

      "summary": "The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the \"alter-based\" and \"ego-based\" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.",

      "summary": "Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.",

We obtained route-level ridership from automated passenger counter (APC) data and service performance metrics from the General Transit Feed Specification Real Time (GTFS-RT) data. The panel dataset allows us to effectively isolate the independent effects of OTP and frequency on bus ridership, contributing to a better understanding of how to improve service quality and support ridership. Our analysis examines both a pre-COVID period (January 2018-December 2019) and a post-COVID recovery period (July 2021-July 2023). Descriptive analysis reveals a steady ridership decline before the pandemic, followed by a sharp drop during the pandemic and a gradual recovery to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022. This recovery, however, varied by route and was accompanied by significant temporal fluctuations in service performance measures. To analyze these dynamics, we developed two-way fixed effects (2FE) models. Model outputs show that while frequency consistently influences ridership over time, OTP becomes an increasingly important determinant in the post-COVID recovery period. The observed significant interaction between frequency and OTP in the recovery period further suggests that improving reliability is particularly effective on frequent routes. Our study also highlights the need for targeted ridership-boosting strategies that differ by time of day, with a focus on punctuality during AM-peak and frequency during midday and PM-peak, to better support ridership growth and improve network performance.",

However, the role of sub-exponential growth -- a slower-than-exponential pattern known in epidemiology -- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of 2,963 items, selected for reliable estimation (e.g., sufficient duration/peak, monotonic growth), reveals that 1,625 (55%) diffusion patterns without abrupt level shifts were adequately described by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter $α$ was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the peak diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate $R$, with minor contributions from $α$ or the duration $T$; and (iii) $α$ showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model of outward (stranger) vs. inward (community) contact suggests that $α$ can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.",

In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.",

      "summary": "This study analyzes pass networks in football (soccer) using a stochastic model known as the Pólya urn. By focusing on preferential selection, it theoretically demonstrates that the time evolution of networks can be characterized by a single parameter. Building on this result, a data analysis method is proposed and applied to a large-scale public dataset of professional football matches. The statistical properties of the preferential-selection parameter are examined, demonstrating its correlation with pass accuracy and with mean pass difficulty. This method is applicable to various evolving networks.",

      "title": "Legal Entanglement",
      "summary": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.",

      "summary": "Digital network failures stemming from instabilities in measurements of temporal order motivate attention to concurrent events. A century of attempts to resolve the instabilities have never eliminated them. Do concurrent events occur at indeterminate times, or are they better seen as events to which the very concept of temporal order cannot apply? Logical dependencies of messages propagating through digital networks can be represented by marked graphs on which tokens are moved in formal token games. However, available mathematical formulations of these token games invoke \"markings\" -- global snapshots of the locations of tokens on the graph. The formulation in terms of global snapshots is misleading, because distributed networks are never still: they exhibit concurrent events inexpressible by global snapshots. We reformulate token games used to represent digital networks so as to express concurrency. The trick is to replace global snapshots with \"local snapshots.\" Detached from any central clock, a local snapshot records an action at a node during a play of a token game. Assemblages of local records define acyclic directed graphs that we call history graphs. We show how history graphs represent plays of token games with concurrent motions, and, importantly, how history graphs can represent the history of a network operating while undergoing unpredictable changes.",

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a promising LDES solution, though its economic viability, especially for long storage durations beyond lithium-ion battery capabilities, remains unclear. To address this, here we compiled and analyzed a global emerging adiabatic CAES cost database, showing a continuous cost reduction with an experience rate of 15% as capacities scaled from 10MW to 100MW. Our lifecycle discounted cash flow analysis suggests that adiabatic CAES could achieve economic viability for 10-100 hour storage durations, particularly with optimal geological siting to lower storage costs. This economically viable LDES option will enable large-scale grid balancing and support renewable integration over multi-day periods, making it a valuable asset for advancing deep decarbonization of energy systems.",

In order to explore this issue, the paper analyzes a pre-logical setting, by considering a formalized approach to the foundations of psychoanalysis in logic, interpreting and integrating the views by Freud, Matte Blanco, Klein and Bion. The formalized approach derives from a quantum model of spin states. A representation of the spin state of a particle in first order logic is abstracted to get a modality interpretable as an abstract projector. The last can be decomposed into a positive, negative and irreal component. The irreal component cannot emerge and, in logic, is absorbed by the two others, giving rise to logical duality.

However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.",

      "summary": "Voluntary carbon-free electricity (CFE) procurement has the potential to accelerate electric sector decarbonization, but procurement strategies vary widely, leading to uncertainty about emissions, investments, and costs. This study assesses the system-wide effects of voluntary CFE procurement on U.S. regional power systems using a detailed energy systems model across a range of program designs, eligible technologies, policy environments, and modeling assumptions. Results suggest that hourly matching, where clean electricity procurement aligns with hourly load, combined with new and local generation could maximize emissions reductions from CFE procurement, particularly under existing Inflation Reduction Act incentives and state policies. However, regional costs vary significantly, with a CFE cost premium ranging from \\$11-63/MWh nationally across scenarios and \\$1-130/MWh across regions, broader than previous estimates. Expanding the eligible technology portfolio to include renewables, nuclear, carbon capture, and energy storage reduces costs, particularly in regions with lower wind and solar resource quality, though variable renewables and battery storage remain the dominant resources in many scenarios. Additionally, we show that the future policy environment strongly influences the effectiveness of voluntary CFE programs, with more stringent emissions policies or subsidies potentially limiting the incremental benefits of procurement. The analysis also quantifies how features of the model framework can shape insights about CFE procurement strategies.",

      "summary": "Although a number of studies have investigated human mobility patterns during natural hazards, mechanistic models that capture mobility dynamics under large-scale perturbations, such as extreme floods, remain scarce. Leveraging mobile phone data and building upon recent insights into universal mobility patterns, we assess whether the general structure of population flows persists during the extreme floods that struck Emilia-Romagna, Italy, in 2023. Our analysis reveals that the relationship between visitor density, distance, and visitation frequency remains robust even under extreme flooding conditions. To disentangle the effects of distance and visitation frequency, we define two aggregated visitor densities: the marginal density over frequency and the aggregated density over distance. We find that the marginal density over frequency exhibits a time-invariant power-law exponent, indicating resilience to flooding disturbances. In contrast, the aggregated density over distance displays more complex behavior: an exponential decay over biweekly periods and a power-law decay over a monthly interval. We propose that the observed power law emerges from the superposition of exponential distributions across shorter timescales. These findings provide new insights into human mobility scaling laws under extreme perturbations, highlighting the robustness of visitation patterns and suggesting avenues for improved mechanistic modeling during natural disasters.",

      "summary": "While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.",

Drawing on concepts from ecological population dynamics, diffusion processes, and stochastic exchange theory, the model captures the probabilistic mechanisms underlying item mixing, recovery, and loss. Each cohabitant is represented as an autonomous agent whose belongings interact through iterative cycles of collective washing, sorting, and partial correction. The system's evolution is characterized by random mixing events, selective recollection, and attrition over time. Implemented using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, the model demonstrates that even minimal exchange probabilities can generate emergent asymmetries, quasi-equilibrium distributions, and long-term disorder. The findings illustrate how stochastic processes inherent to shared domestic systems can produce persistent imbalances, offering a quantitative perspective on an everyday social phenomenon.",

      "summary": "The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities involving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by countable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species, dictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \\sim r^{-α}$ between type count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely observed to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is Heaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the total number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose an idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument improves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic expression for all values of $α$, which corrects the special cases of $α= 1$ and $α\\gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of count rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a general type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.",

This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.",

      "summary": "Introduction: The inclusion of Breaking in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games introduced a distinctive competition format in which two athletes compete head-to-head in battle rounds. Unlike other aesthetic sports, where athletes receive independent scores for their performances, Breaking judges assess the relative performance quality between two competitors across five predefined evaluation aspects. This may considerably increase their cognitive load and warrants a thorough examination of judging reliability and potential national bias, the tendency of judges to favor athletes from their own country. Methods: Official scoring data from the 2024 Olympic Breaking events were analyzed. Interrater reliability was assessed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, while national bias was estimated using mixed-effects modelling based on judges' individual scores. Results: The analyses revealed low to moderate interrater reliability in Breaking, notably lower than levels reported in other aesthetic sports. Moreover, substantial national bias was detected, with judges displaying a systematic tendency to favor athletes from their own country. Discussion: Although the observed national bias, despite its notable magnitude, likely had only a limited effect on final competition outcomes, the relatively low interrater reliability highlights potential weaknesses in the current scoring framework that may warrant refinement. Nonetheless, Breaking's unique system of aggregating judges' scores into discrete votes appears to reduce the influence of individual judges on competition outcomes, thereby enhancing the system's robustness against unilateral score manipulation.",

Historical evidence shows that the first industrial revolution, pre-scientific in the sense that technological adoption preceded scientific understanding, initially disrupted this ratio: EPE collapsed as profits outpaced efficiency, with poorly integrated technologies, and recovered only with the rise of scientific knowledge and societal adaptation. Later industrial revolutions, such as electrification and microelectronics, grounded in established scientific theory, did not exhibit comparable declines. Today's AI revolution, highly profitable yet energy-intensive, remains pre-scientific and may follow a similar trajectory in EPE. We combine this conceptual discussion with cross-country EPE data spanning the last three decades. We find that the advanced economies exhibit a consistent linear growth in EPE: those countries are the ones that contribute most to global GDP production and energy consumption, and are expected to be the most affected by the AI transition. Therefore, we advocate for regular monitoring of EPE: transparent reporting of AI-related energy use and productivity-linked incentives can expose hidden energy costs and prevent efficiency-blind economic expansion. Embedding EPE within sustainability frameworks would help align technological innovation with energy productivity, a critical condition for sustainable growth.",

      "summary": "We study the necessary condition to detect, by means of spectral modularity optimization, the ground-truth partition in networks generated according to the weighted planted-partition model with two equally sized communities. We analytically derive a general expression for the maximum level of mixing tolerated by the algorithm to retrieve community structure, showing that the value of this detectability threshold depends on the first two moments of the distributions of node degree and edge weight. We focus on the standard case of Poisson-distributed node degrees and compare the detectability thresholds of five edge-weight distributions: Dirac, Poisson, exponential, geometric, and signed Bernoulli. We show that Dirac distributed weights yield the smallest detectability threshold, while exponentially distributed weights increase the threshold by a factor $\\sqrt{2}$, with other distributions exhibiting distinct behaviors that depend, either or both, on the average values of the degree and weight distributions. Our results indicate that larger variability in edge weights can make communities less detectable. In cases where edge weights carry no information about community structure, incorporating weights in community detection is detrimental.",

      "summary": "Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use peer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal information sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance resource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a randomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted search (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective foraging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation, and targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $ρ$, that balances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how $ρ$ influences group efficiency ($η$), temporal variability/burstiness ($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($σ$), revealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $ρ\\to 0$, agents explore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $ρ$ increases, individuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $η$ first rises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency is optimized at interior $ρ$ values that balance exploration and exploitation. At the largest $ρ$, equality among agents is highest, but efficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing negative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.",

      "summary": "In recent years, numerous advances have been made in understanding how epidemic dynamics is affected by changes in individual behaviours. We propose an SIS-based compartmental model to tackle the simultaneous and coupled evolution of an outbreak and of the adoption by individuals of the isolation measure. The compliance with self-isolation is described with the help of the imitation dynamics framework. Individuals are incentivised to isolate based on the prevalence and the incidence rate of the outbreak, and are tempted to defy isolation recommendations depending on the duration of isolation and on the cost of putting social interactions on hold. We are able to derive analytical results on the equilibria of the model under the homogeneous mean-field approximation. Simulating the compartmental model on empirical networks, we also do a preliminary check of the impact of a network structure on our analytical predictions. We find that the dynamics collapses to surprisingly simple regimes where either the imitation dynamics no longer plays a role or the equilibrium prevalence depends on only two parameters of the model, namely the cost and the relative time spent in isolation. Whether individuals prioritise disease prevalence or incidence as an indicator of the state of the outbreak appears to play no role on the equilibria of the dynamics. However, it turns out that favouring incidence may help to flatten the curve in the transient phase of the dynamics. We also find a fair agreement between our analytical predictions and simulations run on an empirical multiplex network.",

Analysing 42,000 visitor journeys and over 50,000 reviews, we identify key drivers of satisfaction, segment visitors by behavioural patterns, examine tour engagement, model spatial navigation, and investigate room popularity. Behavioural clustering uncovered four distinct visitor types: Committed Trekkers, Leisurely Explorers, Targeted Visitors, and Speedy Samplers, each characterised by different levels of engagement and movement. Tour usage analysis revealed high drop-off rates and variation in completion rates across different language groups. Spatial flow modelling revealed that accessibility and proximity, particularly aversion to stairs, shaped visitor paths more than thematic organisation. Room popularity was more strongly predicted by physical accessibility than curatorial content. We propose practical strategies for improving engagement and flow, offering a scalable framework for visitor-centred, data-informed museum planning.",

The retail sector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and consumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on sale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on near-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a dual-clustering approach. We identify multi-scale spatial relationships in retail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using shortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering based on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach, we identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to corroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural communities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently than metropolitan areas. In contrast, we find that metropolitan and capital regions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional profiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic context to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste requires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the importance of region-specific sustainability strategies.",

We use statistical validation techniques to extract ideologically distinct communities of subreddits, in terms of their contributing user base and news consumption, which we use to analyze the dynamics of political debate. We thus reveal clear polarization in both interaction-based and topic-based communities, with clusters of Democratic, Conservative, and Banned subreddits. Election periods intensify cross-group engagement, align Banned and Conservative content, and reduce linguistic diversity within groups. Overall we characterize Reddit as a polarized environment marked by the presence of echo chambers, highlighting network validation as a key method for identifying behavioral and interaction patterns on online social media.",

Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum.

Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion.

      "summary": "Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.",

Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets.",

The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.",

      "summary": "Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.",

However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\\times10^{-11}\\rm g/cm^3$.

In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass.

In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.",

Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.",

We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles. This approach allows us to gain valuable insights into the spacetime geometry of a Schwarzschild-like BH within the King-type DM halo, its physical and radiative properties in the accretion disk, and the corresponding observational implications.",

In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $Υ(φ, T) = C_1 \\frac{T^3}{M_{\\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \\frac{T^3}{φ^2}.$ The two terms in $Υ$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \\gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.",

      "summary": "We investigate how non-local gravitational couplings from double-trace deformation between two asymptotic boundaries of an AdS$_5$ black brane can lead to the violation of the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.",

Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \\emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.",

In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs.

The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.",

In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes.

We find ${\\sim}1$ in 100 signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2 can result in a single photon and thus be detected. Furthermore, after $2\\times10^4$ signals -- equivalent to $10^{-2}$ to $1.5$ years of observation -- photon counting results in a twofold improvement in the measurement of the radius of a $1.6\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star.

      "summary": "We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($Γ(t) \\propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($Γ(t) \\propto \\exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.",

      "summary": "Gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.",

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.",

      "summary": "The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.",

Specifically, we consider a fermionic dark matter interacting via a Yukawa-coupled light scalar, focusing on regimes where the dark forces are stronger than gravitational and yet unconstrained. We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case.",

For smaller values of $|Λ|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics. One family is the (A)dS-Schwarzschild solution, the other is a fine-tuned asymtotically (A)dS-Schwarzschild-Bach solution. We also generalise the above solutions to electrically charged black holes, obtaining qualitatively similar asymptotic behaviour.

In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data. Our findings advocate for further exploration of HDE models using other types of cosmological observations.",

Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $α$ and the degree of anisotropy $β$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $γ_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $α$ and positive anisotropy $(β> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\\,M_\\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(α,β)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable. In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects.",

Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $α$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $χ_{\\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\\angleβ_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $α$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.",

Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source.",

Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $φ$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $γ$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars. These results show that the linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ HMPST subclass provides a consistent and unified description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales, offering a fertile framework for connecting modified gravity to observations and effective field-theoretic extensions.",

In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping.

The scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay are computed explicitly. We consider both small and large black holes, with black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. In addition, for small black holes we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under $ω\\leftrightarrow 1/r_c$ (where $ω$ is the scalar's frequency and $r_c$ the cosmological horizon radius).",

A set of elliptic equations with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizons and at spatial infinity is established for constructing the initial data.

      "summary": "We identify the $r^{-3}$ curvature-decay rate as a universal geometric threshold separating compact from non-compact perturbations of Laplace-type operators on asymptotically flat manifolds. For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\\inσ_{\\mathrm{ess}}(\\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields. These results demonstrate that curvature decay at $r^{-3}$ constitutes a fundamental geometric boundary underlying infrared universality in gauge and gravitational theories, providing a spectral counterpart to the asymptotic-symmetry and soft-theorem formulations of memory.",

A key feature of the new estimate is that it circumvents the use of an integrated local energy decay (ILED) statement. As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold.",

Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum.

The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.",

The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another.

This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions. Furthermore, a non-perturbative analysis of the position-space correlator reveals an instanton contribution, providing a complete characterization of the correlation functions.",

In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.",

The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.",

The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.",

      "summary": "We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.",

Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.",

The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.",

      "summary": "Analysis of complex networks, particularly material networks such as the carbon skeleton of hydrocarbons generated in hydrocarbon pyrolysis in carbon-rich systems, is essential for effectively describing, modeling, and predicting their features. An important and the most challenging part of this analysis is the extraction and effective description of cycles, when many of them coalesce into complex clusters. A deterministic minimum cycle basis (MCB) is generally non-unique and biased to the vertex enumeration. The union of all MCBs, called the set of relevant cycles, is unique, but may grow exponentially with the graph size. To resolve these issues, we propose a method to sample an MCB uniformly at random. The output MCB is statistically well-defined, and its size is proportional to the number of edges. We review and advance the theory of graph cycles from previous works of Vismara, Gleiss et al., and Kolodzik et al. In particular, we utilize the polyhedron-interchangeability (pi) and short loop-interchangeability (sli) classes to partition the relevant cycles. We introduce a postprocessing step forcing pairwise intersections of relevant cycles to consist of a single path. This permits the definition of a dual graph whose nodes are cycles and edges connect pairs of intersecting cycles. The pi classes identify building blocks for crystalline structures. The sli classes group together sets of large redundant cycles. We present the application to an amorphous hydrocarbon network, where we (i) theorize how the number of relevant cycles may explode with system size and (ii) observe small polyhedral structures related to diamond.",

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential.

Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport.

We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of \"squeezing polynomials\" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external \"Janus phase.\" This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect.

In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.",

Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.",

For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry.

      "title": "Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability",
      "summary": "Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.",

      "summary": "We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.",

We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.",

      "summary": "The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.",

This representation-theoretic perspective separates group structure from dynamics: the decomposition of $R\\!\\otimes\\!R'$ fixes the invariant operator algebra and therefore the qualitative entangling power of the process. For particles in the fundamental representation, $\\mathrm{End}_{\\mathrm{SU}(N)}(N\\!\\otimes\\!N)=\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbb{I},\\mathbb{S}\\}$, so only the identity and swap directions preserve separability, whereas generic combinations generate entanglement. Adjoint-adjoint scattering involves a larger invariant algebra involving $d$-tensors and is intrinsically entangling. In Yang-Mills theory one can use color-kinematics duality to show that the color kernel lies on a fixed ray of this operator space, yielding a universal maximum of the outgoing entanglement for scattering at right angles, $E_\\star^{(2)}=\\tfrac{3}{4}$ for $SU(2)$ and $E_\\star^{(3)}\\simeq0.91$, independent of kinematics. Dimension-six operators preserve this universality, while dimension-eight deformations populate new color sectors and shift $E_\\star^{(N)}$, suggesting that entanglement in color space functions as a tomographic probe of effective operators. In helicity space, requiring maximally entangled inputs to scatter into maximally entangled outputs uniquely selects the Yang-Mills quartic coupling and enforces the color Jacobi identity, restating the on-shell Ward constraints as conditions on entanglement preservation. Our results suggest that the information-theoretic viewpoint unifies algebraic, geometric, and dynamical aspects of scattering.",

We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump.

Using three-loop renormalization group equations, we systematically investigate enhancement factors $k = λ_{\\rm enhanced}/λ_{\\rm SM}$ ranging from $k=1.0$ (Standard Model) to $k=7.2$ (radiative electroweak symmetry breaking prediction). We identify $k_{\\rm crit} = 1.03$ as the marginal case where the coupling transitions from negative to positive evolution at high energies. For $k > 1.03$, the theory exhibits absolute vacuum stability and develops UV poles at $Λ_{\\rm UV} \\sim 10^{16}$--$10^{18}$ GeV, signaling effective field theory breakdown and the onset of strong dynamics. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario with $k \\approx 7.2$ falls deep in this regime, naturally connecting the electroweak scale to compositeness or other strong-coupling physics near the GUT scale.

We do not observe such a phenomenon in white dwarfs. (2) In the white dwarfs, influence of stellar medium imperceptibly affects on bremsstrahlung photons. Also, we have accurate description of bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions in Sun.

The amplitude of the infrared variability is comparable to that in gamma-rays, and larger than at optical or UV wavelengths. The X-ray flux is not strongly correlated with either the gamma-rays or longer wavelength data.

By combining LCDM hierarchical structure formation theory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar population synthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select LBGs at redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. The broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these model LBGs are then analysed by fitting galaxy template SEDs derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly declining SFRs. We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical parameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as derived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the semi-analytic model. We find some trends in these distributions: first, when the redshift is known, SED-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of LBGs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimate the masses overall, but with substantial scatter. Second, there are large systematic biases in the distributions of best-fit SFRs and mean ages, in the sense that single-component SED-fitting methods underestimate SFRs and overestimate ages. We attribute these trends to the different star formation histories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxy templates used in SED-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from the current generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. These biases, which arise from the SED-fitting procedure, can significantly affect inferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.",

Our focus is on the non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the assembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial symmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and alpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the shock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be viewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D simulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of material with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside the zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach a large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite convection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the recombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D than in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes a slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts out at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other mechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out that recombination heating takes over.",

      "title": "Reaction of Accretion Disks to Abrupt Mass Loss During Binary Black Hole Merger",
      "summary": "The association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair of supermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example, it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by Bode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely. However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable. This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk. Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future X-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.",

We can reproduce the smooth Fermi/HESS spectra as well as the spiky ATIC/PPB-BETS spectra. The spectra have a sharp cutoff that is similar to the dark matter predictions, sometimes together with a line (not similar), since higher energy cosmic-rays cool faster where the cutoff/line energy marks the source age. A GRB-like astrophysical source is expected to have a small but finite spread in the cutoff/line as well as anisotropy in the cosmic-ray and diffuse gamma-ray flux, providing a method for the Fermi and future CALET experiments to discriminate between dark matter and astrophysical origins.",

      "summary": "We study the impact of catastrophic errors occurring in the photometric redshifts of galaxies on cosmological parameter estimates with cosmic shear tomography. We consider a fiducial survey with 9-filter set and perform photo-z measurement simulations. It is found that a fraction of 1% galaxies at z_{spec}~0.4 is misidentified to be at z_{phot}~3.5. We then employ both chi^2 fitting method and the extension of Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the bias on the equation of state parameters of dark energy, w_0 and w_a, induced by those catastrophic outliers. By comparing the results from both methods, we verify that the estimation of w_0 and w_a from the fiducial 5-bin tomographic analyses can be significantly biased. To minimize the impact of this bias, two strategies can be followed: (A) the cosmic shear analysis is restricted to 0.5<z<2.5 where catastrophic redshift errors are expected to be insignificant; (B) a spectroscopic survey is conducted for galaxies with 3<z_{phot}<4. We find that the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed scales as N_{spec} \\propto f_{cata}\\times A where f_{cata}=1% is the fraction of catastrophic redshift errors (assuming a 9-filter photometric survey) and A is the survey area. For A=1000 {deg}^2, we find that N_{spec}>320 and 860 respectively in order to reduce the joint bias in (w_0,w_a) to be smaller than 2σand 1σ.

      "summary": "Our ability to determine stellar ages from measurements of stellar rotation, hinges on how well we can measure the dependence of rotation on age for stars of different masses. Rotation periods for stars in open clusters are essential to determine the relations between stellar age, rotation, and mass (color). Until recently, ambiguities in vsini data and lack of cluster membership information, prevented a clear empirical definition of the dependence of rotation on color. Direct measurements of stellar rotation periods for members in young clusters have now revealed a well-defined period-color relation. We show new results for the open clusters M35 and M34. However, rotation periods based on ground-based observations are limited to young clusters. The Hyades represent the oldest coeval population of stars with measured rotation periods. Measurements of rotation periods for older stars are needed to properly constrain the dependence of stellar rotation on age. We present our plans to use the Kepler space telescope to measure rotation periods in clusters as old as and older than the Sun.",

      "summary": "The super-storm of November 20, 2003 was associated with a high speed coronal mass ejection which originated in the NOAA AR 10501 on November 18. This coronal mass ejection had severe terrestrial consequences leading to a geomagnetic storm with DST index of -472 nT, the strongest of the current solar cycle. In this paper, we attempt to understand the factors that led to the coronal mass ejection on November 18. We have also studied the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field of NOAA AR 10501, the source region of this coronal mass ejection. For this purpose, the MDI line-of-sight magnetograms and vector magnetograms from Solar Flare Telescope, Mitaka, obtained during November, 17-19, 2003 were analysed. In particular, quantitative estimates of the temporal variation in magnetic flux, energy and magnetic field gradient were estimated for the source active region. The evolution of these quantities was studied for the 3-day period with an objective to understand the pre-flare configuration leading up to the moderate flare which was associated with the geo-effective coronal mass ejection. We also examined the chromospheric images recorded in H-alpha from Udaipur Solar Observatory to compare the flare location with regions of different magnetic field and energy. Our observations provide evidence that the flare associated with the CME occurred at a location marked by high magnetic field gradient which led to release of free energy stored in the active region.",

This MONDian paradigm is not only competitive with the conventional CDM in a large range of scales, but also even more successful in the galactic scale. Recently, by studying 6 lensing systems, Ferreras et al. (2008) claimed that MOND still needs dark matter even in galactic scales. When we study the same systems, however, we yield an opposite conclusion. In this contribution, we report our result and conclude that MOND does not need dark matter in galactic lensing systems.

We review the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final stages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter. Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.",

Recently Ueta et al. and Batcheldor et al. have suggested that NICMOS possesses a residual instrumental polarization at a level of 1.2-1.5%. This would completely inhibit the data reduction in a number of GO programs, and hamper the ability of the instrument to perform high accuracy polarimetry. We obtained polarimetric calibration observations of three polarimetric standards at three spacecraft roll angles separated by ~60deg. Combined with archival data, these observations were used to characterize the residual instrumental polarization in order for NICMOS to reach its full potential of accurate imaging polarimetry at p~1%. Using these data, we place an 0.6% upper limit on the instrumental polarization and calculate values of the parallel transmission coefficients that reproduce the ground-based results for the polarimetric standards. The uncertainties associated with the parallel transmission coefficients, a result of the photometric repeatability of the observations, are seen to dominate the accuracy of p and theta. However, the updated coefficients do allow imaging polarimetry of targets with p~1.0% at an accuracy of +/-0.6% and +/-15deg. This work enables a new caliber of science with HST.",

We illustrate the potential of the approach by studying reconstruction performances on simulations of two different kinds of signals observed with very generic interferometric configurations.

The second kind is the imprint of cosmic strings in the temperature field of the cosmic microwave background radiation, of particular interest for cosmology.",

      "summary": "Like other starburst galaxies, M82 hosts compact, massive young star clusters that are interesting both in their own right and as benchmarks for population synthesis models. Can spectral synthesis models at resolutions around 1000 adequately reproduce the near-IR spectral features and the energy distribution of these clusters between 0.8 and 2.4 microns? How do the derived cluster properties compare with previous results from optical studies?\n  We analyse the spectra of 5 massive clusters in M82, using data acquired with the spectrograph SpeX on the InfraRed Telescope Facility (NASA/IRTF) and a new population synthesis tool with a highly improved near-IR extension, based on a recent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars. We obtain excellent fits across the near-IR with models at quasi-solar metallicity and a solar neighbourhood extinction law. Spectroscopy breaks a strong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-IR colours in the red supergiant-dominated phase of evolution. The estimated near-IR ages cluster between 9 and 30 Myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due to luminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. They do not always agree with optical spectroscopic ages. Adding optical data sometimes leads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law. This is not surprising considering small-scale structure around the clusters, but it has no significant effect on the near-IR based spectroscopic ages. [abridged]",

There are two sources, VLA 1 (=IRAS 05491+0247) and VLA 2, with the VLA 1 source driving the HH 111 jet. Thermal emission is seen in 1.33 mm continuum tracing the dust in the envelope and the putative disks around the sources. A flattened, torus-like envelope is seen in C18O and 13CO around the VLA 1 source surrounding the dust lane perpendicular to the jet axis, with an inner radius of ~ 400 AU (1\"), an outer radius of ~ 3200 AU (8\"), and a thickness of ~ 1000 AU (2.5\"). It seems to be infalling toward the center with conservation of specific angular momentum rather than with a Keplerian rotation as assumed by Yang et al. 1997. An inner envelope is seen in SO, with a radius of ~ 500 AU (1.3\"). The inner part of this inner envelope, which is spatially coincident with the dust lane, seems to have a differential rotation and thus may have formed a rotationally supported disk. The outer part of this inner envelope, however, may have a rotation velocity decreasing toward the center and thus represent a region where an infalling envelope is in transition to a rotationally supported disk. A brief comparison with a collapsing model suggests that the flattened, torus-like envelope seen in C18O and 13CO could result from a collapse of a magnetized rotating toroid.",

      "summary": "Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be twisted by sudden crustal motions (\"starquakes\"). The twisted magnetosphere does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting magnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (\"cavity\") and a current-carrying bundle of field lines (\"j-bundle\"). The cavity has a sharp boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star. Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum possible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss implications for other magnetars. The untwisting theory suggests that the nonthermal radiation of magnetars is preferentially generated on a bundle of extended closed field lines near the dipole axis.",

      "summary": "SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 is the first known PG1159 star in a close binary with a late main sequence companion allowing a dynamical mass determination. The system shows flux variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.7 mag and a period of about 6.96h. In August 2007, 13 spectra of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 covering the full orbital phase range were taken at the TWIN 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Alméria, Spain). These confirm the typical PG1159 features seen in the SDSS discovery spectrum, together with the Balmer series of hydrogen in emission (plus other emission lines), interpreted as signature of the companion's irradiated side. A radial velocity curve was obtained for both components. Using co-added radial-velocity-corrected spectra, the spectral analysis of the PG1159 star is being refined.\n  The system's lightcurve, obtained during three seasons of photometry with the Göttingen 50cm and Tübingen 80cm telescopes, was fitted with both the NIGHTFALL and PHOEBE binary simulation programs. An accurate mass determination of the PG1159 component from the radial velocity measurements requires to first derive the inclination, which requires light curve modelling and yields further constraints on radii, effective temperature and separation of the system's components. From the analysis of all data available so far, we present the possible mass range for the PG1159 component of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9.",

For b<0 rotating black holes with dimensionless spin a>1 are allowed. We investigate the role of the tidal charge b in the orbital resonance model of QPOs in black hole systems. The orbital Keplerian, the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies of the equatorial, quasicircular geodetical motion are given and their radial profiles are discussed. The resonant conditions are given in three astrophysically relevant situations: for direct (parametric) resonances, for the relativistic precession model, and for some trapped oscillations of the warped discs, with resonant combinational frequencies. It is shown, how b could influence matching of the observational data indicating the 3:2 frequency ratio observed in GRS 1915+105 microquasar with prediction of the orbital resonance model; limits on allowed range of the black hole parameters a and b are established. The \"magic\" dimensionless black hole spin enabling presence of strong resonant phenomena at the radius where ν_K:ν_θ:ν_r=3:2:1 is determined in dependence on b. Such strong resonances could be relevant even in sources with highly scattered resonant frequencies, as those expected in Sgr A*. The specific values of a and b are given also for existence of specific radius where ν_K:ν_θ:ν_r=s:t:u with 5>=s>t>u being small natural numbers. It is shown that for some ratios such situation is impossible in the field of black holes. We can conclude that analysing the microquasars high-frequency QPOs in the framework of orbital resonance models, we can put relevant limits on the tidal charge of brany Kerr black holes.",

These jets transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is dissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the produced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of different progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar models (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets with fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening angle ($5^\\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz factor region $Γ\\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the surface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of $Γ$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for free expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation between the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the progenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars. This trend is also imprinted in the angular distribution of isotropic equivalent energy.",

This method reduces the problem of solving a second-order nonlinear differential equation (Navier-Stokes equation) to that of an effective first-order equation. Viscosity breaks down the invariance of the equilibrium conditions for stationary inflow and outflow solutions, and distinguishes accretion from wind. Under a dynamical systems classification, the only feasible critical points of this \"quasi-viscous\" flow are saddle points and spirals. A linearised and radially propagating time-dependent perturbation gives rise to secular instability on large spatial scales of the disc. Further, on these same length scales, the velocity evolution equation of the quasi-viscous flow has been transformed to bear a formal closeness with Schrödinger's equation with a repulsive potential. Compatible with the transport of angular momentum to the outer regions of the disc, a viscosity-limited length scale has been defined for the full spatial extent over which the accretion process would be viable.",

After constructing and fitting all light curves and spectra to power-law models, we classify the components of each afterglow in terms of the canonical X-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of the forward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. The closure relations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristics including the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energy injection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range of parameters. With this technique, we survey the X-ray afterglows with strong evidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jet breaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%), leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. Those X-ray light curves that do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of the jet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. The distribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with a median of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-Swift. On average Swift GRBs have lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results in lower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-Swift GRBs. Finally, we explore the implications for GRB jet geometry and energetics.",

      "title": "Constraints on Dark Energy from the Observed Expansion of our Cosmic Horizon",
      "summary": "Within the context of standard cosmology, an accelerating universe requires the presence of a third `dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. The available data, however, are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological constant. In this paper, we examine the cosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in addition to the more conventional co-moving coordinates. This procedure explicitly reveals the role played by the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in the interrogation of the data. (In Rindler's notation, R_h coincides with the `event horizon' in the case of de Sitter, but changes in time for other cosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation.) With this approach, we show that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant is clearly disfavored by the observations. Within the framework of standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an equation describing the evolution of R_h, and solve it using the WMAP and Type Ia supernova data. In particular, we consider the meaning of the observed equality (or near equality) R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0, where t_0 is the age of the Universe. This empirical result is far from trivial, for a cosmological constant would drive R_h(t) towards ct (where t is the cosmic time) only once--and that would have to occur right now. Though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of dark energy, for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is given by scaling solutions, which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model, including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for the fact that R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0.",

      "title": "Reversal of the amplitude difference of kHz QPOs in six atoll sources",
      "summary": "AIMS: For six neutron-star atoll sources (4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53, 4U 0614+09, 4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1735-44) we investigate the relationship between the observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether this displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the proposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude between the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R. We compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set II has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous segments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we find that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the two twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow interval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources to explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II. There is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four sources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented clustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources studied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the frequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is roughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models, with some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the existence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at which the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a more general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible existence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.",

      "title": "The origin of 'Great Walls'",
      "summary": "A new semianalytical model that explains the formation and sizes of the 'great walls' - the largest structures observed in the universe is suggested. Although the basis of the model is the Zel'dovich approximation it has been used in a new way very different from the previous studies. Instead of traditional approach that evaluates the nonlinear density field it has been utilized for identification of the regions in Lagrangian space that after the mapping to real or redshift space (depending on the kind of structure is studied) end up in the regions where shell-crossing occurs. The set of these regions in Lagrangian space form the progenitor of the structure and after the mapping it determines the pattern of the structure in real or redshift space. The particle trajectories have crossed in such regions and the mapping is no longer unique there. The progenitor after mapping makes only one stream in the multi-stream flow regions therefore it does not comprise all the mass. Nevertheless, it approximately retains the shape of the structure. The progenitor of the structure in redshift space depends on a few non-Gaussian fields and also it is strongly affected by two anisotropic fields that determine the pattern of great walls as well as their huge sizes. All the fields used in the mappings are derived from the linear potential smoothed at the current scale of nonlinearity which is $R_{nl} = 2.7$ {\\hmpc} for the adopted parameters of the \\lcdm universe normalized to $σ_8 = 0.8$. The model predicts the existence of walls with sizes significantly greater than 500 {\\hmpc} that may be found in sufficiently large redshift surveys.",

      "summary": "There is no direct evidence for radiation domination prior to big-bang nucleosynthesis, and so it is useful to consider how constraints to thermally-produced axions change in non-standard thermal histories. In the low-temperature-reheating scenario, radiation domination begins at temperatures as low as 1 MeV, and is preceded by significant entropy generation. Axion abundances are then suppressed, and cosmological limits to axions are significantly loosened. In a kination scenario, a more modest change to axion constraints occurs. Future possible constraints to axions and low-temperature reheating are discussed.",

By tracking helium-3–bearing dust trapped (or blocked) by ancient ice, researchers built a remarkably detailed history of Arctic coverage stretching back 30,000 years. Their findings reveal powerful links between sea ice, nutrient availability, and the Arctic food web, offering hints about how future warming may reshape everything from plankton blooms to geopolitics."

The results suggest dark energy’s density could be slowly declining, altering the fate of the cosmos and fueling excitement that we may be witnessing the universe’s next great revelation."

One of the most intriguing recent problems is quantifying the similarity between CRISPR perturbations, for example, whether they up-regulate the same set of downstream genes. In this context, genetic convergence refers to the phenomenon where CRISPR disruptions of different genes lead to a similar downstream outcome. Existing methods are mostly heuristic. We present XConTest, a two-step, cross-validated procedure for assessing the genetic convergence problem. The test statistics calculated from that procedure are approximately standard normal when the two perturbations have an orthogonal influence on the cell expression profile. We apply XConTest to two studies: an investigation of the common impact of a suite of autism genes, and a large-scale study of genes associated with immune response to determine sets of genes with common functionality.",

          "summary": "Background: Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defences is a major mechanism exacerbating HF, involving activation of cardiac fibroblasts (FB) and fibrosis. In addition to reducing ROS production and/or scavenging, boosting cellular anti-oxidant capacity is a potential strategy, with FB an interesting target. Methods: We interrogated single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human failing and non-failing hearts to identify OS modulating genes. Differential gene expression analysis in FB and comparison with other cell types was used for identification of candidate genes. The functional role of the identified candidate was studied in primary isolated human FB in culture, using knock-down strategies and phenotype manipulation using TGF-{beta}1. Results: Across the different cardiac cell types, FB showed the greatest enrichment for OS-modulating genes downregulated in HF. Of these genes, the microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1), was exclusively expressed and downregulated in FB, inversely correlating with elevated ROS levels in HF tissue. TGF-{beta}1 treatment of non-HF FB reduced MGST1 expression. MGST1 knockdown in non-HF FB raised expression of periostin, but not of collagen. ROS production and susceptibility to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation were also increased. Downregulation of ferroptosis-suppressing and iron-handling genes inversely correlated with MGST1 expression. Conclusion: Loss of MGST1 in HF is unique to FB, linked to FB activation. It impairs FB antioxidant capacity, exacerbating oxidative stress, and reduces resistance to ferroptosis. Through these mechanisms, loss of FB MGST1 induces a deleterious positive feedback on cardiac remodelling in human HF.",

However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways. This multimodal framework provides insights into structural propagation in inherited retinal dystrophies and may serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at photoreceptor restoration.",

          "summary": "The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.",

            "value": "The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility."

We found that relative phase of Vm theta oscillations across neurons exhibit gradual or discrete shifts depending on spatial position.

To this end, we used a conditional knockout model with postnatal TCF7L2 loss in the thalamus and partial deficiency in the pancreas. Tcf7l2 knockout mice exhibited social deficits and reduced motor habituation. In parallel, they also developed systemic glucose intolerance, modelling the psychiatric-metabolic comorbidity. Thalamic depletion of TCF7L2 resulted in elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase an enzymatic gatekeeper for pyruvate utilization in energy production in the thalamus and cortex. This was accompanied by altered thalamic and cortical metabolism, characterized by reduced efficiency of pyruvate oxidation alongside enhanced oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Notably, a ketogenic diet alleviated metabolic dysregulation in the brain and normalized the approach to social novelty in knockout mice.

          "summary": "Understanding how the brain encodes temporal order in communication is central to explaining how complex interactions are perceived as coherent events. In humans, disrupting the sequence of words or scenes abolishes characteristic activity in higher-order networks, but whether similar mechanisms exist in nonhuman primates remains unknown. Here we used ultra-high-field fMRI (9.4 T) in awake marmosets to test how the marmoset brain evaluates temporal structure in natural conspecific vocalizations. Animals heard vocal sequences from three social contexts (angry, conversational, food-related) presented in intact, reversed, or randomized order, with call identity held constant. Disrupting sequence order altered responses across a distributed cortical-subcortical network. Contrast to reversed order, intact sequences drove stronger activation in prefrontal, cingulate, parietal, and somatosensory regions, whereas randomization produced the most widespread disruptions, additionally recruiting motor, insular, hippocampal, and thalamic territories. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed a core network - including prefrontal area 8, cingulate areas 24/32, somatosensory cortex, and parietal Tpt - consistently sensitive to temporal coherence, with broader recruitment under severe disruption. Network-level dynamics further varied by context: conversation elicited earlier sensitivity to sequence disruptions, angry peaked later, and food built more gradually. These findings provide the first whole-brain evidence that marmosets engage hierarchically organized, context-sensitive networks to evaluate multi-agent vocal sequence structure, establishing a cross-species bridge to human narrative processing.",

However, the functional impact of SCZ-associated genes in microglia remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an arrayed CRISPR targeting screen of 30 schizophrenia-associated genes predicted to be differentially expressed in human microglia-like cells. Target genes were prioritized based on post-mortem transcriptomic relevance and predicted ontology-based roles in phagocytosis pathways. We quantified phagocytic activity and morphological changes following gene targeting using high-content confocal imaging. Key targets, including CYFIP1, MSR1, TREM2, SYK, ITGB2, ITGAM and IRF8, modulated phagocytosis and altered morphological properties consistent with activation states, validating their functional roles in microglia. To elucidate transcriptional impact, we further applied a multiplexed RNA sequencing platform across gene targets. These analyses revealed gene-specific transcriptional signatures, implicating divergent pathways related to phagocytic, activation, cytoskeletal, and lysosomal function. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-based functional genomics in characterizing microglia function and identifying new target genes and mechanisms that may underlie their contributions to schizophrenia pathophysiology.",

Here, we identify extracellular ATP (eATP), a major damage-associated molecular pattern, and its purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as pivotal drivers of early pathology in AD mice. In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed a significant cortical accumulation of eATP in AD mice as early as 2 months of age--before amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment. This increase is associated with inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, microglia reactivity, aberrant synaptic pruning and perineuronal net degradation. Strikingly, genetic deletion of P2X7R rescues these alterations. Two-photon calcium imaging further demonstrates that P2X7R knockout counteracts AD-related neuronal hyperactivity. These findings set the eATP-P2X7R signaling axis as an early driver of AD pathology, linking neuroinflammation to synaptic remodeling and circuit dysfunction, and suggest P2X7R inhibition as a compelling strategy to counteract AD progression.",

However, most studies have focused on crop species, and little is known about its potential use for weed management. In this study, we examined whether air plasma influences the germination of Echinochloa crus-galli, a major paddy field weed. When seeds were cultivated without stratification, direct irradiation with air plasma did not enhance germination. In contrast, once dormancy was partially released by cold stratification, plasma treatment significantly promoted germination. Interestingly, the effect disappeared after prolonged chilling, when dormancy was completely released. These results suggest that plasma promotes germination by acting on the dormancy-breaking process. In addition, plasma-activated water (PAW) also stimulated germination, although its effect was weaker than that of gaseous plasma. Overall, this study demonstrates that air plasma can promote the germination of grass weed seeds, providing a potential strategy for weed control by inducing germination prior to crop seeding.",

          "summary": "Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) refers to untreatable blinding diseases characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss. Photoreceptor degeneration is often associated with an excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. To explore the interplay between PARP and calpain activity, we employed organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice and from the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Retinae were treated with the PARP inhibitors INO1001 or Olaparib, the poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor JA2131, or the transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) blocker 8-Br-ADPR. Readouts included the TUNEL assay to detect cell death, in situ activity assays for histone-deacetylases (HDAC), PARP, and calpain, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP, PARG, and TRPM2 inhibition reduced calpain activity and calpain-2 activation. PARP activity was decreased by PARP and TRPM2 inhibitors but not by PARG inhibition. Remarkably, the PARP inhibitor INO1001 increased HDAC activity unlike any of the other compounds. When combined with the PARG inhibitor JA2131, INO1001 reduced photoreceptor cell death in a synergistic fashion, although such synergy was not observed for calpain or PARP activity. Moreover, synergistic photoreceptor preservation was not observed when JA2131 was combined with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Overall, these results indicate that in rd1 photoreceptors, PARP controls calpain activity via PARG and TRPM2-induced Ca2+ influx. We also characterize INO1001 as potentially more beneficial for IRD treatment than Olaparib. Our study details the complexity of PARP-signalling in photoreceptors and identifies PARG and TRPM2 as new targets for IRD therapy development.",

          "summary": "Pregnancy induces neuroanatomical changes in the human brain. Earlier studies detected traces of motherhood decades after childbirth. It is unclear whether these reflect persisting traces of pregnancy or effects of parenthood. We investigated effects of past birth and of pregnancy loss in women, and effects of fatherhood in men, using univariate and machine learning analyses on 205 regional brain volumes. A group of mothers and an age-matched sample of nulliparous women (N=4357 per group, mean age 63 years) from the UK Biobank, with no past pregnancy losses, showed significant volumetric group differences in 14 regions at Bonferroni-adjusted =.05. Likewise, we identified 18 significant group differences between age-matched samples of fathers and non-fathers of the same size (mean age 63.4), with 9 regions overlapping between sexes. Brain-wide association statistics for past live birth in mothers and those for fatherhood correlated (r = 0.55). XGBoost machine learning models trained to classify parenthood status separately in both datasets showed performance that was low, but significantly above chance (10-fold cross validation: AUC=0.56, p<1e-5 Motherhood classifier, AUC=0.54, p<1e-5, Fatherhood classifier, 10k permutations). We tested the motherhood classification model on an independent test sample comprising of four age-matched groups: 1. women who have never been pregnant, 2. women with past pregnancy loss but no live births, 3. women with live births but no pregnancy loss, and 4. women who experienced both. Class probability was significantly associated with live births, but not past loss. These findings may suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of past childbirth partly also reflect traces of parenthood and not solely persisting traces of past pregnancy, although a more detailed characterization of pregnancy loss data would be needed for full confirmation of this interpretation. Therefore, further research is needed to quantify the extent and understand the nature of these changes, particularly considering the known vulnerability for mental disorders associated with reproductive events.",

We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception.

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the primary bioactive components of Panax notoginseng, possess potent antioxidative and vasoprotective activities. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PNS regulate endothelial integrity and BBB permeability under oxidative stress conditions. Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were treated with hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative damage, followed by intervention with PNS. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that Akap12 (A kinase anchoring protein 12) and Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) were key molecules involved in PNS mediated endothelial protection. H2O2 exposure markedly suppressed Akap12 expression and inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to elevated AQP1 expression and increased BBB permeability. PNS treatment reversed these effects by restoring Akap12 expression, reactivating PI3K/AKT signaling, and reducing AQP1 levels. Functional validation further showed that AQP1 dysregulation altered the expression balance of tight junction proteins, including Claudin5 and ZO1, thereby impairing barrier function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PNS protect endothelial cells from oxidative injury by activating Akap12 dependent PI3K/AKT signaling and modulating AQP1 associated tight junction remodeling. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of PNS mediated BBB protection and suggests potential therapeutic targets for oxidative or ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.",

NLRP12 is a cytosolic protein with inflammation-promoting and inflammation-attenuating properties. NLRP12 exhibits tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting effects that may be cancer, cell-type, context-dependent, aided by differences in the microenvironment contributing to the pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, colitis-associated cancer, and glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a grade IV malignant brain tumor with poor patient survival and high tumor recurrence due to a heterogeneous cell population and angiogenesis. Our previous research reported NLRP12 as a potential prognostic marker for GBM with high expression in GBM patient tissues. In the present study, we investigated the role of NLRP12-mediated signalling between GBM and tumor-adjacent astrocytes, using a comprehensive panel of experimental models, including LN-229 GBM and SVG astrocyte cell lines, cell line-derived spheroids, patient-derived primary glioma cells, and patient-derived glioma organoids. We report that NLRP12 deficiency reduces cell proliferation and viability in the LN-229 cells, but increases these parameters in SVG cells. Furthermore, NLRP12-deficient LN-229 cells display attenuated ability to form three-dimensional spheroids, indicating a role of NLRP12 in anchorage-independent growth, which is considered a hallmark of tumorigenicity. Analysis of patient-derived glioma tissue and patient-derived GBM organoids revealed differential expression of NLRP12. Our findings suggest that NLRP12 modulates GBM cell proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent growth in a cell-context dependent manner. The cell-type-specific roles of NLRP12 may underlie its complex contribution to GBM pathophysiology with implications for therapy and prognosis.",

While prophylactic vaccines prevent infection, effective therapeutics for existing HPV-associated malignancies remain lacking.

Using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we demonstrate that AA binds to E7, increasing its thermal stability and suggesting a direct molecular interaction. Mass spectrometry-based interactome analysis revealed that AA treatment reshapes the E7 interactome, enriching for E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR4, TRIP12, TRIM28), the scaffold protein SQSTM1, and HSP40/HSP70 chaperone complexes involved in protein quality control and misfolded protein signaling. These data support a model in which AA binding induces conformational changes in E7 that enhance its recognition by ubiquitin-proteasome and chaperone-mediated degradation pathways. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into AA's antiviral mode of action and highlight its potential as a lead compound for targeted degradation of HPV oncoproteins.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing across diverse domains, translating the complex language of DNA into human-readable form remains challenging due to genomic data complexity and unexplored regions of the human genome. Current (genomic) language models either have a solid understanding of natural language or of the genomic code. Models fusing both aspects are largely lacking. Results: Here we present Genolator, a multimodal large language model that integrates embeddings from DNA sequences, amino acid sequences, and protein structures with natural language queries. Fine-tuned on over 370,000 question-answer pairs generated using abstracted Gene-Ontology (GO) terms, Genolator effectively answers queries regarding protein subcellular localization, molecular function, and biological processes. Evaluation demonstrates high accuracy in confirming or denying protein function associations, outperforming baseline models such as openly available allrounder LLMs like GPT 4.1 as well as smaller domain specific models integrating knowledge from foundation models like Evo2 and ESM-2. Explorations of the Genolator's hidden states unveil a biologically and linguistically plausible organization of its learned representations. Conclusion: Genolator enhances accessibility to genomic information by enabling natural language interaction with protein data, facilitating biological discovery, and clinical research. It represents a step towards bridging genomic code and human language through the integration of a multimodal LLM.",

Applied to multiple real IST datasets of varying cell densities, DenoIST restores gene expression specificity and clarifies local biological structures by identifying and filtering transcripts spilt over from neighbouring cells. The denoised data enable more consistent and interpretable cell type annotation by minimising conflicting gene expression profiles, reducing the prevalence of hybrid or ambiguous cell types, and enhancing the contrast between distinct functional compartments.

RNA-based signatures suffer from poor reproducibility due to batch effects and platform heterogeneity between microarray and RNA-seq data, limiting machine learning applications. Methods: We developed a computational pipeline harmonizing RNA-seq data from multiple repositories using ComBat batch correction, followed by Random Forest and XGBoost classification. Restricting analysis to RNA-seq platforms only, we achieved 14,137 common genes between TCGA-PAAD (n=178) and validation cohort GSE71729 (n=357). We quantified batch correction efficacy via silhouette coefficients and trained models on survival outcomes. Results: ComBat correction eliminated dataset-specific clustering (silhouette coefficient: 0.866[-&gt;]-0.012). Random Forest achieved 64% training accuracy, identifying five prognostic biomarkers: LAMC2, DKK1, ITGB6, GPRC5A, and MAL2. These genes showed consistent importance across models and biological relevance to invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tumor suppression. Models successfully generalized independent validation data. Conclusions: We present the first open-source R pipeline optimized for RNA-seq-based, cross-cohort biomarker discovery in pancreatic cancer. Platform-matched datasets yielded superior gene coverage versus multi-platform approaches, enabling robust machine learning classification. Our framework identifies five novel prognostic genes and provides a reproducible method for multi-center RNA biomarker studies, available through an interactive Shiny application.",

Inhibitors of the cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 were reported previously, but their effect on the mitochondrial mis-localization of TDP-43 and the mitochondrial function remains to be investigated. Three internal peptide sequences from TDP-43, M1, M3, and M5, were found to enable TDP-43's mitochondrial localization and competitive inhibition using these peptides thwarted mitochondrial import of TDP-43 and rescued TDP-43-induced cytotoxicity to neurons. Here, we performed a virtual in silico screening of 2115 FDA-approved small molecules for affinity against the M3 region of TDP-43 (aa: 146-150) that lies in the RNA recognition motif-1 (RRM1) domain. Multiple all-atom MD simulations were carried out starting with two different conformations of the tandem RRMs to understand the dynamics of the target M3 region in explicit solvent water. The analysis of the simulation trajectories suggests that the M3 region is relatively non-flexible and buried relative to the other regions of the tandem RRM1-2 domains. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), from virtual screening, docked consistently with the M3 region in different docking strategies even amidst the region's poor solvent accessibility. Vitamin D3 also remained stably bound to the M3 region in most frames of four replica MD simulations, each of one microsecond. Taken together, our study proposes vitamin D3 as a potential binder to the M3 region which may inhibit the pathogenic mitochondrial mis-localization of TDP-43.",

Taken together, our study proposes vitamin D3 as a potential binder to the M3 region which may inhibit the pathogenic mitochondrial mis-localization of TDP-43."

          "summary": "Ostensive communication, characterized by direct eye contact and other attention-catching signals, shapes how humans from an early age encode and remember novel objects, specifically biasing their memory toward identity-relevant features. Dogs are sensitive to human ostensive cues and reliably follow gaze direction after communicative addressing. However, whether these signals also enhance and modulate object encoding as in humans remains unknown. In a preregistered eye-tracking study, we tested pet dogs (N = 35) in a violation-of-expectation paradigm. A human actor either directed eye contact toward the dog or looked away before looking at an object. After an occlusion event, dogs viewed one of three outcomes: the same object in the same location (no change), the same object in a different location (location change), or a different object in the same location (identity change). We measured the dogs' looking times during the outcome phase within predefined areas of interest around the object. In line with our predictions and consistent with earlier findings with human infants, dogs looked significantly longer at identity changes in the communicative than in the no-eye-contact condition. In contrast, looking times at location and no-change outcomes were unaffected by communicative context, indicating a selective enhancement of identity encoding. During the initial addressing phase, pupil dilation was greater in the eye-contact condition, suggesting increased arousal or engagement. These findings demonstrate that dogs, like human infants, exhibit a communication-induced memory bias, revealing a shared capacity for ostension-guided learning that may facilitate information transfer between humans and dogs.",

          "summary": "Background: Cancer-associated cachexia, a frequent complication of solid tumours, is not recorded in cancer registries. Cachexia affects patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, a detailed characterization of nutritional and body composition parameters matched with blood-based, non-invasive markers is lacking. We hypothesized that a systematic characterization of cachectic patients may facilitate the development of interventions aimed to improve clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 51 patients diagnosed with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by immunotherapy at the HUB-ICO Comprehensive Cancer Centre from 2022 to 2024. The primary objectives were (1) to determine the prevalence of cachexia according to Fearon criteria and (2) to comprehensively characterize patients before and after completing chemoradiotherapy in terms of nutritional status, metabolic parameters, body composition and circulating cytokine levels. Here, we report the baseline assessment results. Results: Most patients were male (80%), ever smokers (98%) with a median age of 68 years. All patients completed the planned concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen, while only 43% initiated durvalumab consolidation therapy. At baseline, 53% of patients met the diagnostic criteria for cachexia. Women were more likely to have cachexia at baseline compared to men, although these differences were not statistically significant. Cachexia was significantly associated with tumor stage (p < 0.001), performance status (p = 0.027), lower skeletal muscle index (p = 9e-4) and total adipose tissue index (p = 0.004), elevated C-Reactive Protein blood levels (p = 0.004), moderate to severe malnutrition (p < 0.001), reduced caloric intake (p = 0.007) and diminished physical strength (p=0.001). Proteomic profiling using the O-link platform revealed significant differences in circulating cytokine levels between cachectic and non-cachectic patients. Cachexia was significantly associated with elevated levels of CCL23, IL-6, IL-11, Oncostatin M (OSM), pentraxin-related protein 3 (PTX3), and agouti-related protein (AGRP), among others, demonstrating varying degrees of correlation with caloric intake. GDF15 was associated with weight loss (p = 0.00014), but not with calorie intake or body composition. Conclusions: This prospective study reveals that cancer cachexia is highly prevalent in patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. In addition to previously known cytokines, we identified several understudied cytokines, which may contribute to a more comprehensive characterization of the cachexia phenotype and help uncover potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",

          "summary": "Background: Undernutrition among children under five remains a critical global health challenge, contributing to higher mortality. Traditional therapeutic foods often overlook the gut microbial derangements, critical for nutrient assimilation, growth, and long - term recovery. Finger millet, with its exceptional nutritional profile, stands as a sustainable alternative to cereal - based foods to address this nutritional gap while supporting gut health and inflammation. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate a Finger Millet - based Complementary Food (FMCF) as a nutrient - dense, safe, and acceptable intervention for moderately acute malnourished (MAM) children. Methods: Finger millet (GPU-28) was germinated, roasted, and gamma - irradiated to improve nutrient bioavailability, reduce antinutrients, and ensure microbial -safety. We enrolled 200 children (100 MAM, 100 Healthy controls) aged 18 - 59 months from Anganwadi Centres. Participants have been randomized to receive either FMCF or an equicaloric wheat-based control (Balamrutham+) for 8 -weeks. Anthropometry, dietary intake, gut - microbiota composition, and inflammation marker estimation and correlation will be performed at different timepoints. Results: Product analysis revealed superior protein - energy ratio, fibre, calcium, and micronutrient content in FMCF compared to Balamrutham+. Microbiological and aflatoxin testing confirmed safety and shelf-life stability. Pilot feeding trial showed higher consumption (81 -98%) and shorter eating times (53 - 71%, p <0.001). Conclusion: FMCF is promising, cost-effective, and scalable intervention for nutritional-recovery in MAM, with potential to modulate the gut - microbiome and alleviate inflammation. The product aligns with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), reinforcing its relevance as a public-health intervention.",

          "summary": "Inferring transmission relies on accurately distinguishing between isolates from the same source and those from different sources, and high-quality genomic data is frequently used to model transmission scenarios. The post-enrichment metagenome sequencing (pe-MGS) method uses a sequencing approach to analyse the diversity of a target pathogen enriched by pre-culturing, and has been effectively used to analyse the transmission of nosocomial infections. However, a direct comparison of single nucleotide variant (SNV) call accuracy, cost and feasibility between single colony whole genome sequence (sc-WGS) data and pe-MGS for an antimicrobial resistant bacteria of clinical importance, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-EC), is required for implementation in large-scale clinical studies.

            "value": "Inferring transmission relies on accurately distinguishing between isolates from the same source and those from different sources, and high-quality genomic data is frequently used to model transmission scenarios. The post-enrichment metagenome sequencing (pe-MGS) method uses a sequencing approach to analyse the diversity of a target pathogen enriched by pre-culturing, and has been effectively used to analyse the transmission of nosocomial infections. However, a direct comparison of single nucleotide variant (SNV) call accuracy, cost and feasibility between single colony whole genome sequence (sc-WGS) data and pe-MGS for an antimicrobial resistant bacteria of clinical importance, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-EC), is required for implementation in large-scale clinical studies.

Objective: We conducted a knowledge graph-guided analysis of MS-specific disease-modifying therapy (DMT) prescription trends using longitudinal real-world clinical data. Methods: We utilized registry-linked electronic health records (EHR) data from two large independent healthcare systems encompassing both academic and community practices (2004-2022). We applied a novel and efficient Knowledge-driven Online Multimodal Automated Phenotyping (KOMAP) algorithm to identify patients diagnosed with MS and evaluated algorithm performance against chart-reviewed and registry-recorded diagnosis labels. To assess temporal trends in DMT prescriptions, we combined the two cohorts and constructed time-varying temporal knowledge graphs using the patient-level EHR data segmented by calendar year. For each year, we analyzed co-occurrence patterns between DMTs and MS diagnosis by using Shifted Positive Pointwise Mutual Information transformation and singular value decomposition to generate embeddings. We computed patient-wise cosine similarities and confidence intervals. Results: The phenotyping algorithm achieved robust performance in predicting MS diagnosis (AUROC: MGB=0.994, UPMC=0.922), identifying 29,169 MS patients in the combined dataset. Among commonly used standard-effectiveness DMTs, prescriptions for interferon-beta (slope=-0.018{+/-}0.011, p<0.001) and glatiramer acetate (slope=-0.013{+/-}0.012, p=0.026) and fumarates (slope=-0.031{+/-}0.010, p<0.001) declined after 2013. Use of S1P receptor modulators (slope=-0.026{+/-}0.016, p=0.005) declined after 2015. Among commonly used higher-effectiveness DMTs, B-cell depletion therapies (slope=0.051{+/-}0.027, p<0.001), particularly ocrelizumab (slope=0.020{+/-}0.016, p<0.001), showed a marked increase since 2017. Natalizumab usage peaked in 2012 (slopepre-2012=0.063{+/-}0.012, ppre-2012<0.001; slopepost-2012=-0.027{+/-}0.008, ppost-2012<0.001).

This study was designed to test and validate the use of nearables and passive sensing technologies, including Kinect RGB-D cameras and ultra-wideband (UWB) radar, for continuous, objective assessment of gait fluctuations in PD within a home-like setting. Fifteen PD patients with mild symptoms and fourteen age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) performed 4-meter walking tasks in a living lab facility.

Gait features, including stride length, stride time, and gait speed, were extracted from Kinect, radar, and a ground-truth smart floor. Data were analyzed to evaluate inter-sensor agreements and detect group-level differences. Stride time demonstrated the highest agreement between devices (r=0.903), while stride length showed weaker agreement (r=0.779), with Kinect tending to overestimate. Despite lower agreement, stride length from both Kinect and radar successfully distinguished PD OFF from HC (camera q=0.020; radar q=0.005) and radar was able to further differentiate ON and OFF states (q=0.020). Neither device differentiated PD ON from HC, indicating medication reduced observable gait differences. This study demonstrates that passive, contact-free sensing technologies such as depth cameras and UWB radars can effectively monitor gait in PD within naturalistic environments.

          "summary": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by persistent synovial inflammation, yet the processes driving disease progression are not completely understood. Here, we examined the role of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and neutrophils in RA pathophysiology, using primary FLS, neutrophils, and synovial fluid (SF) from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, as well as healthy controls. Our findings demonstrate that FLS and neutrophils drive an immunothrombotic state in RA SF by expressing tissue factor (TF), an effect mediated by JAK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that RA SF stimulates IL-8 (CXCL8) expression in control FLS through PAR-1 signaling, and this response was attenuated by DNase I treatment and CIT-013, a monoclonal antibody targeting anti-citrullinated histones H2A and H4 in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), supporting the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by NETs. Notably, FLS derived from RA patients exhibit enhanced CXCL8 expression, and elevated IL-8 levels were detected in RA SF, both contributing to neutrophil recruitment, a process that could be mitigated through blockade with an anti-CXCL-8 neutralizing antibody. These results suggest an amplification loop in which TF expression, thrombin activity, and NET formation converge to activate FLS, sustain IL-8 mediated neutrophil migration, and perpetuate synovial inflammation, revealing how stromal and immune cells interact to propagate RA pathophysiology.",

          "summary": "Background: Precise glioma segmentation in MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, optimal treatment planning, and advancing clinical research. However, most deep learning approaches require complete, standardized MRI protocols that are frequently unavailable in routine clinical practice. This study presents and evaluates GlioMODA, a robust deep learning framework designed for automated glioma segmentation that delivers consistent high performance across varied and incomplete MRI protocols. Methods: GlioMODA was trained and validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset (1,251 training, 219 testing cases), systematically assessing performance across eleven clinically relevant MRI protocol combinations. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) and panoptic quality metrics. Volumetric accuracy was benchmarked against manual ground truth, and statistical significance was established via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Benjamini-Yekutieli correction. Results: GlioMODA demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy across tumor subregions, maintaining robust performance with incomplete or heterogeneous MRI protocols. Protocols including both T1-weighted contrast-enhanced and T2-FLAIR sequences yielded volumetric differences versus manual ground truth that were not statistically significant for enhancing tumor (ET: median difference 55 mm^3, p = 0.157) and whole tumor (WT: median difference -7 mm^3, p = 1.0), and exhibited median DSC differences close to zero relative to the four-sequence reference protocol. Omitting either sequence led to substantial and significant volumetric errors. Conclusions: GlioMODA facilitates reliable, automated glioma segmentation using a streamlined two-sequence protocol (T1-contrast + T2-FLAIR), supporting clinical workflow optimization and broader implementation of quantitative volumetry compatible with RANO 2.0 criteria.

          "summary": "Abstract Infertility affects a substantial proportion of couples in low- and middle-income countries, yet access to fertility care remains limited. In India, research has primarily focused on psychosocial and biomedical aspects of infertility, with limited attention to care-seeking behaviours. Understanding the determinants of care-seeking is essential to promote equitable access to infertility services. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1,530 married women, aged 18-30 years, intending to conceive and living in low- to middle-socioeconomic urban neighbourhoods of Delhi who had not conceived after 18 months of participation in a preconception randomized-control trial. Structured interviews captured sociodemographic characteristics, fertility intentions, psychosocial experiences, and care-seeking actions. Care-seeking was categorized as formal (health system providers), informal (family or traditional healers), or mixed. Overall, 69.9% of women sought some form of help for delayed conception and, among them 85.5% consulted both formal and informal sources. Multivariable logistic regressions identified predictors of care-seeking where longer duration of trying to conceive (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.6 per year, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), perceiving conception as taking too long (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.5), feeling isolated (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), emotional abuse from husbands (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) or family members (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2), and heavy menstrual bleeding (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2) were associated with greater odds of care-seeking, while regular menstrual cycles were associated with lower odds (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9). The negative association of regular cycles with care-seeking was significantly modified by social isolation (interaction aOR 3.78, 95% CI 1.20-11.89). The most common reason for not seeking care was the perception of not having a problem. Nearly seven in ten women with delayed conception sought some form of help, often through mixed care pathways. Findings highlight the need to integrate psychosocial support and fertility education into accessible, affordable infertility services within the public health system.",

This study assessed trends in youth use of these products in England, Canada, and the US, focussing on evaluating the impact of England's May 2020 ban on menthol in cigarettes but not non-cigarette tobacco. Methods: Data were from the ITC Youth Tobacco and Vaping Survey (16-19-year-olds; N=129,575) across ten waves (2017-2024). Segmented regressions assessed changes in trends of non-cigarette tobacco products before vs. after May 2020, adjusting for race/ethnicity/sex/age. Results: In England, non-cigarette tobacco use increased similarly before (aOR=1.16,1.02-1.31) and after (1.13,1.07-1.20) the ban (change in trend: 0.98,0.91-1.06), from 7.4% in 2017 and reaching in 11.6% in 2024. In contrast, non-cigarette tobacco use decreased similarly before and after the ban in both the US (pre-ban: 0.82, 0.73-0.93; post-ban: 0.84,0.80-0.89; change in trend: 1.02,0.94-1.11; from 10.2% reaching 7.1%), and Canada (pre-ban: 0.84,0.76-0.93; post-ban: 0.90,0.86-0.94; from 9.2% reaching 7.9%), although the decline in Canada after the ban was slightly slower (1.07,1.001-1.15). Cigarillo, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use specifically increased to a greater extent in England than Canada and the US. Conclusions: Between 2017 and 2024, youth non-cigarette tobacco product use increased in England and surpassed declining use in Canada and the US. There was little evidence that England's menthol cigarette ban accelerated increases, although increases highlight the need for comprehensive regulations encompassing all tobacco products in England.",

At the same time, disparities in both the availability and quality of trees by neighborhood disadvantage have been noted, and the relationship between tree canopy and health is sometimes ambiguous. This study employs observational, secondary data to study the associations between urban tree canopy and self-reported mental and physical health in Alabama, a state with a history of redlining that contributed to neighborhood disadvantage and environmental degradation. Multivariate linear regression models were estimated to explore the relationship between self-reported poor mental and physical health and tree canopy aggregated at the census-tract level in Alabama, USA. A stepwise modeling framework initially revealed a negative correlation between poor mental health and less extensive tree canopy. However, this relationship was suppressed when lack of insurance, which had a strong correlation with poverty, was included. It is likely that in areas of higher poverty, more extensive tree canopy may even exacerbate poor health. It seems likely that, for tree canopy to benefit health and well-being, it is important to consider the quality of the neighborhood trees and to address concerns the community may have regarding maintenance and safety issues around neighborhood trees.",

While electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in depression diagnosis, its utility in identifying suicidal risk remains underexplored.

Methods: In this retrospective observational study, resting-state EEG data were collected using Stress EEG Assessment (SEA) system. SR Index was developed by integrating the PHQ-9 scale with EEG-derived features, including band power, coherence, and fractal dimension, optimized using ML algorithms to enhance accuracy. Results: The study included 268 participants (159 without suicidality, 109 with suicidality). The SR Index demonstrated robust discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.8117 (2.63e-18). At the optimal cutoff value of 8, the model achieved 88.99% sensitivity, 57.23% specificity, 67.86% positive predictive value, and 78.85% negative predictive value, with a balanced accuracy of 73.11%.

Early identification of at-risk youth is important for effective intervention, though it remains challenging due to the multifactorial nature of risk.

Methods: We used data from 13,743 adolescents (mean age 14.45 years; 52.7% female) participating in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), linked to national health registries. Logistic regression with elastic net regularization was applied to predict the risk of an internalizing disorder (mood, anxiety or stress-related) occurring within one to five years after assessment.

          "summary": "In meta-analyses of psychological interventions, trials occasionally report effects that appear implausibly large. While such results are unlikely to reflect genuine treatment effects, this is rarely verifiable, and studies are often retained in the meta-analytic evidence. Existing guidance allows for highly questionable results to be discarded in evidence syntheses, but of-fers little direction on how to identify them in practice. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent suspicious evidence has biased effect estimates in psychological intervention research. In this study, we develop a simple flagging tool to detect such trials, based on the (1) compatibility of their effect size with low risk of bias evidence, (2) achieved power, and (3) methodological rigor. We also examine specific characteristics of studies flagged by this tool, and the impact of their exclusion on pooled estimates and heterogeneity. In total, 2,881 effect sizes from 1,246 randomized trials were included from twelve living databases of psychological interventions for mental health problems. Overall, 5.3% of all effects (n=153 across 102 studies) were flagged. Reanalysis of 135 meta-analyses from a large-scale evaluation of psychological interventions showed that excluding flagged studies led to substantially lower effect estimates (reductions of up to 31.2%) and decreased between-study heterogeneity (up to 51.1%; indication-wide analyses). The flagging tool has been integrated into the open-source R package \"metapsyTools\". We discuss potential explanations for the accumulation of improbable findings in the published literature, and how the application of our tool may strengthen quality control in meta-analytic research.",

            "value": "In meta-analyses of psychological interventions, trials occasionally report effects that appear implausibly large. While such results are unlikely to reflect genuine treatment effects, this is rarely verifiable, and studies are often retained in the meta-analytic evidence. Existing guidance allows for highly questionable results to be discarded in evidence syntheses, but of-fers little direction on how to identify them in practice. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent suspicious evidence has biased effect estimates in psychological intervention research. In this study, we develop a simple flagging tool to detect such trials, based on the (1) compatibility of their effect size with low risk of bias evidence, (2) achieved power, and (3) methodological rigor. We also examine specific characteristics of studies flagged by this tool, and the impact of their exclusion on pooled estimates and heterogeneity. In total, 2,881 effect sizes from 1,246 randomized trials were included from twelve living databases of psychological interventions for mental health problems. Overall, 5.3% of all effects (n=153 across 102 studies) were flagged. Reanalysis of 135 meta-analyses from a large-scale evaluation of psychological interventions showed that excluding flagged studies led to substantially lower effect estimates (reductions of up to 31.2%) and decreased between-study heterogeneity (up to 51.1%; indication-wide analyses). The flagging tool has been integrated into the open-source R package \"metapsyTools\". We discuss potential explanations for the accumulation of improbable findings in the published literature, and how the application of our tool may strengthen quality control in meta-analytic research."

Therefore, characterizing EtOH-producing species enriched in patients with liver disease could help identify putative pathobionts and potential therapeutic treatments. Methods: We investigated EtOH production and tolerance, antimicrobial susceptibility and antimicrobial resistance gene(s) in 33 strains enriched in MASH, alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and HBV patients. An antimicrobial was considered a potential therapeutic option when the ratio of the fecal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration (FC/MIC) was > 10 (1 log10). Results: 92% of species enriched in patients with liver diseases produced detectable amounts of ethanol with a strong association between EtOH tolerance and production (p < 0.05). Candida albicans, Nakaseomyces glabratus and Pichia kudriavzevii produced the highest concentrations of EtOH (1.8 to 3.3 g/L). Enterocloster, a strictly anaerobic bacterial genus, was the bacterial genus with the highest EtOH production (0.8 to 1.6 g/L) in 5 g/L of glucose. Poorly absorbed drugs, amphotericin B, rifaximin and vancomycin, together constituted potential therapeutic options for all tested strains. Conclusions: In addition to yeasts, Lactobacillaceae and Klebsiella, strains of Enterocloster genus isolated from patients with liver diseases produced significant amount of EtOH. Most gut microbial species associated with liver diseases produce and tolerate ethanol, suggesting a possible vicious microbial-ethanol cycle in such context.

We examined the relationship between infection-related hospitalization (IRH) and HF in a large clinical health system and assessed whether adding IRH improved predictive utility of contemporary HF risk equations. Methods: We studied 80,880 adults (14,150 with an IRH, 66,730 age- and sex-matched comparators) aged ?18 years without HF at baseline in the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) between 1/1/2005 ? 12/31/2019. IRH was identified using select International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes from hospital discharge records. HF incidence was defined as ?1 HF-related ICD codes. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between IRH and incident HF. In a separate cohort of 29,219 adults aged 30-79 years without baseline CVD in the REP, we calculated Harrell?s C-statistic to assess whether IRH information improved discrimination of the PREVENT-HF equations. Results: Among 80,880 adults, 53.3% were women, 85.6% were White, 95.1% were non-Hispanic, and mean (SD) age at index was 56.0 (20.0) years. Median follow-up time was 6.2 years. Among the IRH group, 2,729 had an incident HF event (2.51 per 100 person years) versus 4,854 with an incident HF event (0.98 per 100 person years) in the comparator group. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) for incident HF among participants who had an IRH compared to those who did not was 1.50 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.58). This relationship was consistent across different types of infections. In a separate cohort, the addition of IRH to PREVENT-HF increased the C-statistic from 0.776 to 0.779 (change 0.003 [0.001-0.004]). The PREVENT-HF risk score underestimated the 10-year risk of HF by up to 9% among participants with an IRH. Conclusion: IRH was independently associated with incident HF but provided negligible change to overall 10-year HF risk discrimination. However, among individuals with an IRH, incorporating this information meaningfully improved 10-year HF risk prediction, suggesting that severe infections may serve as a risk-enhancing factor warranting enhanced preventive measures, particularly in populations where IRH is more common.",

We investigated the association between dysregulated aldosterone production and cardiac structure, function, and adiposity under controlled physiological conditions in obese hypertensive adults. Methods: Community-dwelling participants with overweight or obesity and stage 1-2 hypertension were prospectively enrolled to undergo comprehensive phenotyping of aldosterone production, along with cardiac and abdominal MRI. Aldosterone production was assessed via four controlled physiological maneuvers designed to assess both renin-independent aldosterone production: seated saline suppression testing (SST) and oral sodium loading (OSLT), and ACTH-modifiable aldosterone production: overnight dexamethasone suppression (DST), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation. Cardiac structure and function, cardiac fat volume, hepatic fat content, and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio were assessed by MRI. Results: 72 participants were enrolled, with a mean age of 55.2{+/-}9.5 years, a mean BMI of 37.8{+/-}5.3 kg/m2, and of whom 68.1% were women. After SST, a continuum of non-suppressible and dysregulated aldosterone production was observed, with 29.2% of participants meeting criteria for overt primary aldosteronism. Greater post-SST aldosterone levels were independently associated with greater left ventricular mass index (p<0.001), left ventricular global longitudinal strain (p=0.038), cardiac fat volume (p=0.023), and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (p=0.003). These associations between dysregulated aldosterone production and cardiac remodeling and adipose-tissue parameters were consistently replicated under conditions of oral sodium loading and dexamethasone suppression and ACTH-stimulation. Conclusions: In obese adults with hypertension, dysregulated aldosterone production and overt primary aldosteronism are prevalent and independently associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and increased cardiometabolic adipose tissue volume. These findings highlight a potential pathophysiologic link between aldosterone excess and obesity-related cardiometabolic disease that should be investigated in interventional studies.",

          "summary": "Introduction. Heat significantly impacts human health by causing heat strain or exacerbating pre-existing conditions. Hospitals may suffer a higher healthcare demand during intense heat periods, especially if climate change continues to increase the severity and frequency of heatwaves. Anticipating episodes of higher hospital demand would allow better resource planning and quality of care. Methods. We developed a real-time forecasting tool of daily hospital demand (specifically, all-cause emergency room visits (ERV)) which accounts for the impact of heat. Our tool is based on a regression model integrating temperature-ERV function with autoregressive terms and other temporal trends. The model can (i) quantify the association between the number of hospital visits and temperature based on historical data and (ii) provide accurate short-term forecasts of the daily ERV based on temperature values expected for the upcoming days. As a case study, we used data from the Bern University Hospital from the summer of 2014 to 2022, and mean temperature per day as an indicator of heat exposure. Results. Temperature-ERV relationship exhibited a non-linear shape. We found that, with respect to the mean temperature of minimum risk of 15 {degrees}C, there were approximately 6 (95% CI 2-10) additional ERVs when mean temperature was around 25 {degrees}C, corresponding to a 3% increase in summer 2022. The estimated variation increased for mean temperature above 25 {degrees}C, but with large uncertainty. We also found that our model showed higher accuracy at forecasting hospital demand during periods with particularly hot days, compared to a model neglecting temperature. Our forecasting tool is implemented in a user-friendly R shiny app, allowing for application to new datasets. Conclusions. We found a robust association between ambient temperature and visits to the emergency department in a Swiss hospital. Our findings suggest that including temperature can increase the accuracy of predictions for hospital demand during summer.",

          "summary": "Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries, with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) significantly contributing to associated mortality. Infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions effectively reduced healthcare-associated infections and significantly decreased neonatal mortality in the Sepsis Prevention in Neonates in Zambia (SPINZ) study. Here we use whole genome sequencing to explore the impact of an IPC intervention on K. pneumoniae strains and transmission dynamics responsible for sepsis in a Zambian neonatal unit. Methods and Findings: Blood culture isolates were collected during the SPINZ study, including a 7-month baseline period and 12 months following implementation of a low-cost IPC bundle. Bacterial isolates were sequenced (using Illumina), assembled, and characterised in terms of lineage, AMR determinants, and polysaccharide antigens (using Kleborate and Kaptive). High-quality genome assemblies were obtained for 411 neonatal K. pneumoniae infections. The K. pneumoniae population was diverse, comprising 24 unique STs, but dominated by ST307 (69.3%, n=285). Nearly all isolates (99.0%) carried extended spectrum beta-lactamases, but few carried carbapenemases (2.7%). Probable transmission clusters were identified using single-linkage clustering with pairwise distance thresholds of [&le;]4 weeks and [&le;]10 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between isolates. Most infections (95.6%) were associated with clusters, ranging in size from 2-202 patients and spanning durations of 2-232 days. Most K. pneumoniae (n=228, 70%) were isolated during the 7-month baseline period and formed six clusters, including one cluster of >200 neonates infected with ST307, which was interrupted by the IPC implementation. Novel clusters emerged during the post-intervention period, including additional STs and distinct ST307 lineages (unrelated to the pre-intervention cluster), but also ST2004 and ST101 clusters that were genetically indistinguishable from those detected pre-intervention. Conclusions: In this neonatal unit, K. pneumoniae sepsis was mostly attributable to nosocomial transmission clusters, including a large and sustained outbreak of ST307 affecting >200 neonates over eight months. Transmission of all strains was periodically suppressed by an IPC bundle; however not all strains were eliminated, and some were able to re-emerge later to re-establish infection and transmission, alongside newly introduced strains that formed additional transmission clusters. Some clusters were associated with rapid onset of disease (within 2 days of admission) and others with delayed onset, suggesting different sources of contamination (e.g. reagent vs environmental). These findings reinforce the need for sustained IPC efforts, and better understanding of environmental reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens in neonatal units to inform such efforts.",

This study aimed to describe Indonesia's PPH rates and to quantify variation in PPH across districts/cities and their associations with individual sociodemographic characteristics. Design and setting: Cross-sectional study conducted in Indonesia using the 2023 National Health Insurance Sample Data. Participants: Sample of 2.3 million individuals, representing 266.8 million national health insurance--Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)--enrolees. Outcome measures: PPH overall and by type: vaccine-preventable, acute, and chronic. Methods: We quantified crude and age-standardised rates per 10,000 JKN enrolees. We applied multilevel negative binomial regression and estimated: 1) median rate ratios (MRRs) to quantify variation in PPH across districts/cities, unadjusted and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, and 2) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to quantify associations between PPH and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: There were 4.83 million overall PPHs in 2023, an overall rate of 180.9 per 10,000 JKN enrolees (acute: 94.8, chronic: 93.6, vaccine-preventable: 2.8). Overall PPH rates were generally highest in districts/cities in Java-Bali, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Kalimantan, lower in Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and lowest in Papua. Variation in PPH across districts/cities was similar for all PPH types (MRRs overall: 1.62, vaccine-preventable: 1.83, acute: 1.72, chronic: 1.53) and persisted after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (MRRs of 1.52, 1.82, 1.61, 1.41, respectively). Higher PPH was strongly associated with older age (55-64 and 65-74 years, particularly chronic) and young age (0-14 years, vaccine-preventable, acute), modestly associated with being married or divorced (acute, chronic, overall), and being non-subsidised (all types), and weakly associated with sex (all types). Conclusions: PPHs varied across districts/cities as well as by sociodemographic characteristics.

          "summary": "Understanding the biological mechanisms linking genetic variants to disease risk is essential for advancing precision health. We have developed a causal mediation analysis framework, the C-MAPLE (Causal Mediation Analysis of Pathways Linking Exposures) method, to identify disease-causing pathways for which the effect of genetic variants is mediated through metabolites to impact age-related diseases. Unlike Mendelian randomization, our approach is robust to horizontal pleiotropy, and models multiple mediators and interactions between genetic variants and metabolites simultaneously. To ensure robust model selection, we incorporate least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with stability selection, which can effectively select relevant mediators even in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We also introduce a dynamic adjustment to the number of bootstrap trials to reduce computational burden during uncertainty estimation. Applying this novel framework to the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we identified 190 potential causal links involving 108 genetic variants, 176 metabolites, and 6 age-related diseases. Our method and findings highlight the utility of causal mediation analysis in uncovering metabolite-mediated genetic mechanisms. This method, combined with large-scale population data sets, has the potential to revolutionize the identification of targets for downstream clinical research, and the development of personalized disease prevention, interventions, and therapeutics.",

EntQA demonstrated consistent positive alignments with accuracy (group-level Spearman up to 0.9286; case-level point-biserial up to 0.0926) and model scaling (Spearman up to 0.252), outperforming baselines which often showed negative or inconsistent correlations (e.g., BERTScore Spearman -0.9286 with accuracy).

          "summary": "This study aims to assess the clinical and economic benefits of early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC) in patients with new-onset type 3c diabetes (NOD) using a blood-based, cell-free DNA epigenomic test (Avantect; ClearNote Health, CA). Multiple studies indicate that NOD increases the risk of PC by 6-8 times within the first three years post-diagnosis. A Markov model was created to compare two primary strategies: no testing and testing higher-risk NOD patients using a blood-based cell-free DNA epigenomic test. Additionally, imaging surveillance strategies were also evaluated. Using criteria from Sharma et al. (Gastroenterology, 2018), approximately 20% of the NOD patients were considered to be at higher risk for PC. The risk for developing PC, survival, and cost data were obtained from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare databases. The cell-free DNA epigenomic test has a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 97%. It proves robustly cost-effective in NOD high-risk patients, with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of $56,564 at a Willingness to Pay (WTP) of $100,000 The model predicts that in a cohort of 10,000 patients with NOD, 1% would be diagnosed with PC in the no-testing strategy, with only 7.1% of cases eligible for surgery. In contrast, 71 PC cases are predicted to be detected with cfDNA testing. These cases would be more likely to be detected at an earlier, more treatable stage, with 32.4% eligible for surgical resection. Testing higher-risk patients with NOD for pancreatic cancer using a blood-based cell-free DNA epigenomic test is predicted to be cost-effective compared to the standard of care (no testing). Initiating this test within three years of a diabetes diagnosis is likely to increase the detection of treatable pancreatic cancer cases, potentially improving patient survival outcomes.",

          "summary": "Introduction: Maternal fetal movement monitoring during pregnancy is commonly advised to assess fetal wellbeing. However, qualitative research exploring how women perceive and implement such advice is lacking, particularly in regions with the highest burden of stillbirth. This study investigates women's experiences and opinions on fetal movement monitoring during pregnancy across high- and low-stillbirth settings. Methods: Women from three countries with low-stillbirth rates and five with high rates of stillbirth were surveyed and interviewed regarding their experiences with fetal movement monitoring advice. Open-ended answers from the surveys and interview were analysed using inductive thematic methods, while categorical answers were examined using non-parametric statistical analysis. Results: 234 women were included in the study. The nature and extent of fetal movement monitoring advice varied considerably by country, encompassing active monitoring methods such as kick counting, pattern awareness and movement presence detection, as well as guidance on responding to fetal movements concerns. Notably, 33% (37/112) of women in high-stillbirth countries and 8% (10/122) in low-stillbirth countries reported a lack of any fetal movement monitoring advice. Globally, half of women rated the advice easy to follow, while one-third experienced difficulty understanding their healthcare provider's guidance. Key facilitators of following advice included having an active baby and a clear understanding and confidence in the received advice, whereas barriers included a lack of clarity and understanding, difficulty perceiving movements, competing time demands and challenges in identifying patterns of movements. Maternal anxiety was prevalent, with 78% of participants reporting at least occasional anxiety about fetal movements during pregnancy. Conclusion: Wide variation in the type and consistency of fetal movement monitoring advice across countries indicates the need for further research into the comparative effectiveness of current recommendations, particularly in high-stillbirth settings. High rates of maternal anxiety worldwide highlight the importance of providing support to women navigating fetal movement monitoring.",

It is incurable and, at the time of this study, only two treatments with a limited therapeutical effect are available: riluzole and edavarone (not in Europe). These treatments have been shown to delay the progression of the disease by a maximum of 10%. We recently showed that glycolic acid (GA) and D-lactate (DL) are able to revert some of the phenotypes observed in iPSC-derived neurons from FUS- and SOD-1-ALS patients in vitro. Here we show that the administration of GA and DL is able to delay the progression of the disease in SOD1-G93A mice and protect spinal motor neurons against neuronal death. Interestingly, GA and DL were also able to attenuate the lethality in the TBPH silencing strain (iTBPHpkk(108354)) in Drosophila, showing a conserved role between species. Based on these results, we performed two experimental treatments in ALS patients carrying a disease-causing mutation in FUS and SOD-1 respectively. As GA and DL have been shown to be toxic (kidney stones, altered hepatic metabolism) and even lethal above certain doses in humans, we developed and used a specific formulation containing L-alanine to avoid these side effects. Our results show that, together with L-alanine as supportive treatment , GA and DL were well tolerated by the patients. Although promising, well designed and placebo-controlled clinical trials need to be performed in order to confirm the good tolerability and the therapeutic effects in ALS patients.",

Current approaches rely on costly, invasive, or research-only methods not feasible at scale within public health systems. Objective: To test whether routinely acquired NHS brain MRI scans can be used to predict future dementia diagnosis and whether confidence-based stratification improves prediction reliability and clinical interpretability. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case-control study conducted entirely within a secure NHS Trusted Research Environment. Routine T1-weighted MRI brain scans were linked with electronic health records for participants from Tayside and Fife, Scotland. The study included 259 individuals who subsequently developed dementia and 259 age- and sex-matched controls. Data were processed and modelled between January and June 2025. Exposure: MRI-derived structural brain features analysed using a support-vector-machine model with nested cross-validation and distance-from-hyperplane (DFH) confidence calibration. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were prediction accuracy and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Secondary analyses assessed DFH-stratified performance and time from scan to clinical diagnosis. Results: Confidence-based filtering identified a high-confidence subgroup ({approx}35% of scans) with {approx}80% accuracy. Overall, the model predicted future dementia up to five years before first recorded NHS diagnosis, achieving 66.8% accuracy (AUC = 0.71). Model sensitivity increased for shorter time-to-diagnosis intervals. Analyses were generalisable across heterogeneous routine NHS scanners and datasets. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that routinely collected NHS MRI data can predict future dementia years before clinical diagnosis. Incorporating confidence calibration transforms a standard classifier into a safety-aware, clinically interpretable framework, supporting scalable early detection, risk stratification, and recruitment to preventive or disease-modifying trials across population health systems.",

This condition hinders these youngsters from having a regular upbringing, resulting in behaviors more akin to younger children as they get older. They frequently suffer from mental health concerns and may fail to articulate their needs and desires effectively. The inability to articulate oneself can lead to negative conduct, especially against others who remind them of their parents or siblings.

This article introduces the Integrative Theory of Martial Arts (ITMA), a theoretical framework developed through a systematic theoretical synthesis of interdisciplinary literature. ITMA explains how well designed martial arts training can optimize brain function by combining sensorimotor, cognitive and social-emotional demands. It proposes that these combined experiences drive the brain toward a quasicritical state—a dynamic regime of neural activity that supports health, efficient information processing, adaptability, and resilience. The theory integrates key concepts such as metastability, functional connectivity, neuroplasticity, neural synchronization, and signal-to-noise ratio as part of a single multiscale neurophysiological cascade. Preliminary empirical studies are cited to illustrate the plausibility of ITMA's propositions. By consolidating fragmented evidence into a unified mechanistic model, ITMA provides a new paradigm and testable hypotheses for future research on martial arts as a neurophysiological intervention, offering a roadmap for designing, evaluating, and scaling programs for brain health and human development.",

Indeed, across the 5 experiments and 19 total assessments of context reinstatement, only two statistical tests supported context-dependent working memory facilitation.

          "summary": "Aggressive behavior in children is influenced by different sociodemographic factors. However, there is limited research on the impact of these factors on child aggression in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to explore the sociodemographic factors associated with aggressive behavior among Saudi schoolchildren. A cross-sectional study was performed on 315 school-going children using stratified school selection with caregivers convenience sampling. Caregivers completed the Arabic caregivers-proxy version of the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire-Short form (BPAQ-SF). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between various demographic variables and aggression. The significance level was set at a p < 0.05 throughout the analysis. The findings revealed a significant relationship between different sociodemographic variables and the BPAQ-SF. The results revealed that gender, age, family type, family occupation, parental education, and monthly income were found to be significant predictors of child aggression. Among these demographic factors, female gender (β = −0.15, p < 0.01), higher fathers (β = −0.19, p < 0.01), and mothers education (β = −0.47, p < 0.01) were associated with lower physical aggression scores. Verbal aggression was lower among children in nuclear families (β = 0.11, p < 0.05) and those with higher maternal education (β = −0.31, p < 0.01). Greater anger was observed among young children (<6 years; β = −0.24, p = 0.01), those with unemployed parents (β = −0.14, p = 0.01), lower paternal education (β = −0.19, p = 0.01), and maternal education (β = −0.29, p = 0.01), whereas extended family type showed a positive association with anger (β = 0.12, p = 0.05). Hostility was negatively related with maternal education (β = −0.25, p < 0.01) and monthly income (β = −0.15, p < 0.01). This study identified several demographic factors that played a role in the development of aggression in children. Thus, this study emphasizes that contributing factors should be considered when formulating and applying intervention strategies to manage aggressive behavior in children.",

To study auditory selective attention in more close-to-real-life settings, an auditory task was adapted to a virtual classroom. The new environment suggested evidence of increased attention, possibly introduced by the visual representation, gamification effects, and immersion. This could engage participants more effectively. To delve deeper into the impact of cross-modal effects, the paradigm was extended by visual stimuli. Participants were initially tasked with directing their auditory attention to a cued spatial position and categorizing animal names played from that position while ignoring distracting sounds. Animal pictures introduced in Experiment 1 were either congruent or incongruent with the auditory target stimuli, thus either supporting or competing with the auditory information. The concurrent presentation of animal pictures with the animal names increased response times compared to the auditory condition, and incongruent visual stimuli increased response times more than congruent ones. Fewer errors were made with congruent compared to incongruent pictures, and error rates of the auditory condition fell in between. When the visual stimulus was presented 750 ms or 500 ms before the auditory stimuli in Experiment 2, auditory and visual congruence effects interacted. In the 500 ms case, visually congruent stimuli decreased error rates in auditory incongruent trials. Conversely, visually incongruent stimuli decreased error rates on auditory incongruent trials at 750 ms. This reversal of effects suggests a positive priming effect at 500 ms and a semantic inhibition of return effect at 750 ms. Taken together, these findings indicate that cross-modal priming is at least partially different from multisensory integration.",

Notably, spousal support demonstrates dual moderating effects: Low levels of support amplify the detrimental impact of adversity on marital quality and thereby intensify loneliness; whereas high levels counteract these negative pathways and foster relational resilience.DiscussionThis study provides the first empirical evidence for the dual-directional moderating role of spousal support, which not only buffers against stress but also cultivates relational adaptability.

Drawing on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) framework, this study investigates how digital fatigue influences work engagement and how contextual resources—leadership style and network ties—moderate this relationship. Using survey data from 339 employees in Chinese technology firms, the results show that digital fatigue significantly reduces work engagement. Transformational leadership weakens this negative relationship, while transactional leadership strengthens it. In addition, internal network ties mitigate the adverse effect of digital fatigue, whereas external ties have no significant impact.

          "summary": "Against the backdrop of the “dual carbon” target becoming a national strategy, the environmentally friendly behavior of urban residents has become a key pivot to leverage ecological governance. However, in reality, although most urban residents identify with environmental protection concepts, they are constrained by multiple obstacles such as value conflicts, social norm pressures, economic cost considerations, and institutional contexts in daily practices such as garbage classification and low-carbon travel, forming deep bottlenecks that restrict the effectiveness of environmental governance. This study integrates the DEMATEL-ISM-MICMAC method to construct a three in one analytical framework of “driving mechanism transmission path governance strategy,” revealing the cascading impact chain from fundamental commitment to surface behavior, providing theoretical breakthroughs and practical paths for breaking the cognitive behavioral gap and achieving precise policy supply. The research results indicate that actual commitment (E8) serves as the fundamental driving force, with ultra-high driving force and extremely low dependence as the only independent factors, confirming that value internalization is the core engine of long-term environmental behavior; Environmental responsibility (E15) and civic behavior (E4) form a key hub node, with high centrality and strong interactivity linking the “cognition responsibility action” transformation chain; The surface level target ecological management (E1) exhibits significant passivity and is directly influenced by nine mid-level factors, highlighting the deep dependence of behavior implementation on systemic support. The dual low values of environmental emotion (E6) and verbal commitment (E7) expose their marginal position in the system, and pure emotional mobilization is difficult to activate the main behavioral chain. The four level transmission mechanism of E8 in the fundamental layer, E4/E15 in the middle layer, and E1/E16 in the surface layer further verifies that the improvement of environmental behavior efficiency needs to follow the progressive logic of “value foundation hub transmission terminal empowerment.” This study validates its practical effectiveness in promoting the transformation of residents from “cognitive identity” to “conscious action”, providing an operable and verifiable micro decision-making paradigm for the global urban carbon neutrality process, and promoting the paradigm shift of environmental governance research from factor identification to mechanism analysis and path optimization.",

The company claims it’s a big step toward more general-purpose agents and better real-world robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company first demoed SIMA (which stands for “scalable instructable multiworld agent”) last year. But this new version has been built on top of Gemini, the firm’s flagship large language model, which gives the agent a huge boost in capability. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/13/1127921/google-deepmind-is-using-gemini-to-train-agents-inside-goat-simulator-3/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Will Douglas Heaven</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>These technologies could help put a stop to animal testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, the UK’s science minister announced an ambitious plan: to phase out animal testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing potential skin irritants on animals will be stopped by the end of next year. By 2027, researchers are “expected to end” tests of the strength of Botox on mice. And drug tests in dogs and nonhuman primates will be reduced by 2030.<br /><br />It’s good news for activists and scientists who don’t want to test on animals. And it’s timely too: In recent decades, we’ve seen dramatic advances in technologies that offer new ways to model the human body and test the effects of potential therapies, without experimenting on animals. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/14/1127949/technologies-could-stop-animal-testing/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Jessica Hamzelou</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This article first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review’s weekly biotech newsletter.

By 2027, researchers are “expected to end” tests of the strength of Botox on mice. And drug tests in dogs and nonhuman primates will be reduced by 2030.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news follows similar moves by other countries. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-plan-phase-out-animal-testing-requirement-monoclonal-antibodies-and-other-drugs\">a plan</a> to replace animal testing for monoclonal antibody therapies with “more effective, human-relevant models.” And, following a workshop in June 2024, the European Commission also began working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40266612/\">a “road map” to phase out animal testing for chemical safety assessments</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Animal welfare groups have been campaigning for commitments like these for decades. But a lack of alternatives has made it difficult to put a stop to animal testing. Advances in medical science and biotechnology are changing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals have been used in scientific research&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/45849/chapter-abstract/400770069\">for thousands of years</a>. Animal experimentation has led to many important discoveries about how the brains and bodies of animals work. And because regulators require drugs to be first tested in research animals, it has played an important role in the creation of medicines and devices for both humans and other animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, countries like the UK and the US regulate animal research and require scientists to hold multiple licenses and adhere to rules on animal housing and care. Still, millions of animals are used annually in research. Plenty of scientists <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/21/1093419/animal-testing-organ-on-chip-research/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">don’t want to take part in animal testing</a>. And some question whether animal research is justifiable—especially considering that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23861075/\">around 95% of treatments that look promising in animals don’t make it to market</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent decades, we’ve seen dramatic advances in technologies that offer new ways to model the human body and test the effects of potential therapies, without experimenting on humans or other animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take “organs on chips,” for example. Researchers have been creating miniature versions of human organs inside tiny plastic cases. These&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/21/1093419/animal-testing-organ-on-chip-research/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">systems</a> are designed to contain the same mix of cells you’d find in a full-grown organ and receive a supply of nutrients that keeps them alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, multiple teams have created models of livers, intestines, hearts, kidneys and even the brain. And they are already being used in research. Heart chips have been <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/03/15/heart-tissue-spaceflight-study-launch/\">sent into space</a> to observe how they respond to low gravity. The FDA used lung chips to <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/emulate-signs-collaborative-agreement-with-the-fda-to-apply-lung-chip-to-evaluate-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines-and-protective-immunity-against-sars-cov-2\">assess covid-19 vaccines</a>. Gut chips are being used to <a href=\"https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/a-gut-reaction-on-a-chip/\">study the effects of radiation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some researchers are even working to connect multiple chips to create a “<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028184-000-building-a-human-on-a-chip-organ-by-organ/\">body on a chip</a>”—although this has been in the works for over a decade and no one has quite managed it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same vein, others have been working on creating model versions of organs—and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125523/jacob-hanna-israel-synthetic-embryo-models/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">even embryos</a>—in the lab. By growing groups of cells into tiny 3D structures, scientists can study how organs develop and work, and even test drugs on them. They can even be personalized—if you take cells from someone, you should be able to model that person’s specific organs. Some researchers have even been able to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/04/1089419/organoids-made-from-amniotic-fluid-will-tell-us-how-fetuses-develop/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">create organoids of developing fetuses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK government strategy mentions the promise of artificial intelligence, too. Many scientists have been quick to adopt AI as a tool to help them make sense of vast databases, and to find connections between genes, proteins and disease, for example. Others are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">using AI to design all-new drugs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those new drugs could potentially be tested on virtual humans. Not flesh-and-blood people, but digital reconstructions that live in a computer. Biomedical engineers have already created digital twins of organs. In ongoing trials, digital hearts are being used to guide surgeons on how—and where—to operate on real hearts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When I spoke to Natalia Trayanova, the biomedical engineering professor behind this trial, she told me that her model could recommend regions of heart tissue to be burned off as part of treatment for atrial fibrillation. Her tool would normally suggest two or three regions but occasionally would recommend many more. “They just have to trust us,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/19/1108447/digital-twins-human-organs-medical-treatment-drug-trials/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=11-13-25\">she told me</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unlikely that we’ll completely phase out animal testing by 2030. The UK government acknowledges that animal testing is still required by lots of regulators, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, and the World Health Organization. And while alternatives to animal testing have come a long way, none of them perfectly capture how a living body will respond to a treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least not yet. Given all the progress that has been made in recent years, it’s not too hard to imagine a future without animal testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article first appeared in The Checkup,&nbsp;</em>MIT Technology Review’s<em>&nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Building a model that is more transparent sheds light on how LLMs work in general, helping researchers figure out why models hallucinate, why they go off the rails, and just how far we should trust them with critical tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As these AI systems get more powerful, they’re going to get integrated more and more into very important domains,” Leo Gao, a research scientist at OpenAI, told <em>MIT Technology Review</em> in an exclusive preview of the new work. “It’s very important to make sure they’re safe.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is still early research. The new model, called a weight-sparse transformer, is far smaller and far less capable than top-tier mass-market models like the firm’s GPT-5, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini. At most it’s as capable as GPT-1, a model that OpenAI developed back in 2018, says Gao (though he and his colleagues haven’t done a direct comparison).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the aim isn’t to compete with the best in class (at least, not yet). Instead, by looking at how this experimental model works, OpenAI hopes to learn about the hidden mechanisms inside those bigger and better versions of the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s interesting research, says Elisenda Grigsby, a mathematician at Boston College who studies how LLMs work and who was not involved in the project: “I’m sure the methods it introduces will have a significant impact.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee Sharkey, a research scientist at AI startup Goodfire, agrees. “This work aims at the right target and seems well executed,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why models are so hard to understand</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI’s work is part of a hot new field of research known as mechanistic interpretability, which is trying to map the internal mechanisms that models use when they carry out different tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s harder than it sounds. LLMs are built from neural networks, which consist of nodes, called neurons, arranged in layers. In most networks, each neuron is connected to every other neuron in its adjacent layers. Such a network is known as a dense network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Dense networks are relatively efficient to train and run, but they spread what they learn across a vast knot of connections. The result is that simple concepts or functions can be split up between neurons in different parts of a model. At the same time, specific neurons can also end up representing multiple different features, a phenomenon known as superposition (a term borrowed from quantum physics). The upshot is that you can’t relate specific parts of a model to specific concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Neural networks are big and complicated and tangled up and very difficult to understand,” says Dan Mossing, who leads the mechanistic interpretability team at OpenAI. “We’ve sort of said: ‘Okay, what if we tried to make that not the case?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of building a model using a dense network, OpenAI started with a type of neural network known as a weight-sparse transformer, in which each neuron is connected to only a few other neurons. This forced the model to represent features in localized clusters rather than spread them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their model is far slower than any LLM on the market. But it is easier to relate its neurons or groups of neurons to specific concepts and functions. “There’s a really drastic difference in how interpretable the model is,” says Gao.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gao and his colleagues have tested the new model with very simple tasks. For example, they asked it to complete a block of text that opens with quotation marks by adding matching marks at the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a trivial request for an LLM. The point is that figuring out how a model does even a straightforward task like that involves unpicking a complicated tangle of neurons and connections, says Gao. But with the new model, they were able to follow the exact steps the model took.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We actually found a circuit that’s exactly the algorithm you would think to implement by hand, but it’s fully learned by the model,” he says. “I think this is really cool and exciting.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where will the research go next? Grigsby is not convinced the technique would scale up to larger models that have to handle a variety of more difficult tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gao and Mossing acknowledge that this is a big limitation of the model they have built so far and agree that the approach will never lead to models that match the performance of cutting-edge products like GPT-5. And yet OpenAI thinks it might be able to improve the technique enough to build a transparent model on a par with GPT-3, the firm’s breakthrough 2021 LLM.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Maybe within a few years, we could have a fully interpretable GPT-3, so that you could go inside every single part of it and you could understand how it does every single thing,” says Gao. “If we had such a system, we would learn so much.”</p>"

The company claims it’s a big step toward more general-purpose agents and better real-world robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google DeepMind <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/13/1089764/an-ai-that-can-play-goat-simulator-is-a-step-towards-more-useful-ai/\">first demoed SIMA</a> (which stands for “scalable instructable multiworld agent”) last year. But SIMA 2 has been built on top of Gemini, the firm’s flagship large language model, which gives the agent a huge boost in capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers claim that SIMA 2 can carry out a range of more complex tasks inside virtual worlds, figure out how to solve certain challenges by itself, and chat with its users. It can also improve itself by tackling harder tasks multiple times and learning through trial and error.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SIMA2_InstructionChaining10.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Games have been a driving force behind agent research for quite a while,” Joe Marino, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, said in a press conference this week. He noted that even a simple action in a game, such as lighting a lantern, can involve multiple steps: “It’s a really complex set of tasks you need to solve to progress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate aim is to develop next-generation agents that are able to follow instructions and carry out open-ended tasks inside more complex environments than a web browser. In the long run, Google DeepMind wants to use such agents to drive real-world robots. Marino claimed that the skills SIMA 2 has learned, such as navigating an environment, using tools, and collaborating with humans to solve problems, are essential building blocks for future robot companions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike previous work on game-playing agents such as AlphaZero, which beat a Go grandmaster in 2016, or AlphaStar, which<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z\"> beat 99.8% of ranked human competition players</a> at the video game StarCraft 2 in 2019, the idea behind SIMA is to train an agent to play an open-ended game without preset goals. Instead, the agent learns to carry out instructions given to it by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans control SIMA 2 via text chat, by talking to it out loud, or by drawing on the game’s screen. The agent takes in a video game’s pixels frame by frame and figures out what actions it needs to take to carry out its tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SIMA2_REASONING_11.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like its predecessor, SIMA 2 was trained on footage of humans playing eight commercial video games, including No Man’s Sky and Goat Simulator 3, as well as three virtual worlds created by the company. The agent learned to match keyboard and mouse inputs to actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooked up to Gemini, the researchers claim, SIMA 2 is far better at following instructions (asking questions and providing updates as it goes) and figuring out for itself how to perform certain more complex tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google DeepMind tested the agent inside environments it had never seen before. In one set of experiments, researchers asked Genie 3, the latest version of the firm’s <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/29/1089317/google-deepminds-new-generative-model-makes-super-mario-like-games-from-scratch/\">world model</a>, to produce environments from scratch and dropped SIMA 2 into them. They found that the agent was able to navigate and carry out instructions there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers also used Gemini to generate new tasks for SIMA 2. If the agent failed, at first Gemini generated tips that SIMA 2 took on board when it tried again. Repeating a task multiple times in this way often allowed SIMA 2 to improve by trial and error until it succeeded, Marino said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Git gud</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SIMA 2 is still an experiment. The agent struggles with complex tasks that require multiple steps and more time to complete. It also remembers only its most recent interactions (to make SIMA 2 more responsive, the team cut its long-term memory). It’s also still nowhere near as good as people at using a mouse and keyboard to interact with a virtual world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SIMA2_MultimodalPrompting03_v04.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Julian Togelius, an AI researcher at New York University who works on creativity and video games, thinks it’s an interesting result. Previous attempts at training a single system to play multiple games haven’t gone too well, he says. That’s because training models to control multiple games just by watching the screen isn’t easy: “Playing in real time from visual input only is ‘hard mode,’” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, Togelius calls out GATO, a previous system from Google DeepMind, which—despite being<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/23/1052627/deepmind-gato-ai-model-hype/\"> hyped at the time</a>—could not transfer skills across a significant number of virtual environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, he is open-minded about whether or not SIMA 2 could lead to better robots. “The real world is both harder and easier than video games,” he says. It’s harder because you can’t just press A to open a door. At the same time, a robot in the real world will know exactly what its body can and can’t do at any time. That’s not the case in video games, where the rules inside each virtual world can differ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others are more skeptical. Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher at the University of Alberta, isn’t too surprised that SIMA 2 can play many different video games. He notes that most games have very similar keyboard and mouse controls: Learn one and you learn them all. “If you put a game with weird input in front of it, I don’t think it’d be able to perform well,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guzdial also questions how much of what SIMA 2 has learned would really carry over to robots. “It’s much harder to understand visuals from cameras in the real world compared to games, which are designed with easily parsable visuals for human players,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Marino and his colleagues hope to continue their work with Genie 3 to allow the agent to improve inside a kind of endless virtual training dojo, where Genie generates worlds for SIMA to learn in via trial and error guided by Gemini’s feedback. “We’ve kind of just scratched the surface of what’s possible,” he said at the press conference. &nbsp;</p>"

Over the course of three days of main-stage sessions, I learned about innovations in AI, biotech, and robotics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you might imagine, some of this climate reporter’s favorite moments came in the climate sessions. I was listening especially closely to my colleague James Temple’s discussion with Lucia Tian, head of advanced energy technologies at Google.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>They spoke about the tech giant’s growing energy demand and what sort of technologies the company is looking to to help meet it. In case you weren’t able to join us, let’s dig into that session and consider how the company is thinking about energy in the face of AI’s rapid rise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been closely following Google’s work in energy this year. Like the rest of the tech industry, the company is seeing ballooning electricity demand in its data centers. That could get in the way of a major goal that Google has been talking about for years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, back in 2020, the company <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/247-carbon-free-energy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> an ambitious target: by 2030, it aimed to run on carbon-free energy 24-7. Basically, that means Google would purchase enough renewable energy on the grids where it operates to meet its entire electricity demand, and the purchases would match up so the electricity would have to be generated when the company was actually using energy. (For more on the nuances of Big Tech’s renewable-energy pledges, check out <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/17/1095019/google-amazon-and-the-problem-with-big-techs-climate-claims/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">James’s piece from last year</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s is an ambitious goal, and on stage, Tian said that the company is still aiming for it but acknowledged that it’s looking tough with the rise of AI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was always a moonshot,” she said. “It’s something very, very hard to achieve, and it’s only harder in the face of this growth. But our perspective is, if we don’t move in that direction, we’ll never get there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s total electricity demand more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, according to its <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest Environmental Report</a>. As for that goal of 24-7 carbon-free energy? The company is basically treading water. While it was at 67% for its data centers in 2020, last year it came in at 66%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not going backwards is something of an accomplishment, given the rapid growth in electricity demand. But it still leaves the company some distance away from its finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To close the gap, Google has been signing what feels like constant deals in the energy space. Two recent announcements that Tian talked about on stage were a project involving carbon capture and storage at a natural-gas plant in Illinois and plans to reopen a shuttered nuclear power plant in Iowa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with carbon capture. Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/first-carbon-capture-storage-project/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signed an agreement</a> to purchase most of the electricity from a new natural-gas plant, which will capture and store about 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That announcement was controversial, with critics arguing that carbon capture keeps fossil-fuel infrastructure online longer and still releases greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One question that James raised on stage: Why build a new natural-gas plant rather than add equipment to an already existing facility? Tacking on equipment to an operational plant would mean cutting emissions from the status quo, rather than adding entirely new fossil-fuel infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company did consider many existing plants, Tian said. But, as she put it, “Retrofits aren’t going to make sense everywhere.” Space can be limited at existing plants, for example, and many may not have the right geology to store carbon dioxide underground.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We wanted to lead with a project that could prove this technology at scale,” Tian said. This site has an operational Class VI well, the type used for permanent sequestration, she added, and it also doesn’t require a big pipeline buildout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Tian also touched on the company’s recent <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nextera-energy-and-google-announce-new-collaboration-to-accelerate-nuclear-energy-deployment-in-the-us-302595786.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> that it’s collaborating with NextEra Energy to reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Iowa. The company will purchase electricity from that plant, which is scheduled to reopen in 2029. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I covered in <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/14/1109963/whats-next-for-nuclear-power/?utm_source=the_spark&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_spark.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a story earlier this year</a>, Duane Arnold was basically the final option in the US for companies looking to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants. “Just a few years back, we were still closing down nuclear plants in this country,” Tian said on stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While each reopening will look a little different, Tian highlighted the groups working to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which was the first reopening to be announced, last spring. “They’re the real heroes of the story,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m always interested to get a peek behind the curtain at how Big Tech is thinking about energy. I’m skeptical but certainly interested to see how Google’s, and the rest of the industry’s, goals shape up over the next few years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is from The Spark, </em>MIT Technology Review<em>’s weekly climate newsletter.

It’s often even more acute in the case of a natural disaster, when conspiracy theories about what “really” caused the calamity run right into culture-war-driven climate change denialism. Put together, these theories obscure real causes while elevating fake ones.<br /><br />I’ve studied these ideas extensively, having spent the last 10 years writing about conspiracy theories and disinformation as a journalist and researcher.

In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.<br /><br />While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/15/1124949/bodies-heat-climate-change-extreme-temperatures/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Max G.Levy</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This story is from the latest print issue of MIT Technology Review magazine, which is full of fascinating stories about the body.

Don’t blame wind turbines.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whale deaths have become a political flashpoint. There are currently three active mortality events for whales in the Atlantic, meaning clusters of deaths that experts consider unusual. And Republican lawmakers, conservative think tanks, and—most notably—President Donald Trump (a longtime enemy of wind power) are making dubious claims that offshore wind farms are responsible.<br /><br />But any finger-pointing at wind turbines for whale deaths ignores the fact that whales have been washing up on beaches since long before the giant machines were rooted in the ocean floor. This is something that has always happened. And the scientific consensus is clear: There’s no evidence that wind farms are the cause of recent increases in whale deaths. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126728/whales-are-dying-dont-blame-wind-turbines/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Casey Crownhart</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This story is part of <em>MIT Technology Review</em>’s series “The New Conspiracy Age,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.

That should be particularly worrying in the US, where massive data centers are waiting to come online. It doesn’t look as if the country will build the steady power supply or infrastructure needed to serve them all.<br /><br />It wasn’t always like this. For about a decade before 2020, data centers were able to offset increased demand with efficiency improvements. Now, though, electricity demand is ticking up in the US, with billions of queries to popular AI models each day—and efficiency gains aren’t keeping pace.<br /><br />If we want AI to have the chance to deliver on big promises without driving electricity prices sky-high for the rest of us, the US needs to learn some lessons from the rest of the world on energy abundance. Just look at China.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/09/1126805/the-state-of-ai-energy-is-king-and-the-us-is-falling-behind/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Casey Crownhart &amp; Pilita Clark</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is from The State of AI, our subscriber-only collaboration between the<em> Financial Times</em> &amp; <em>MIT Technology Review</em> examining the ways in which AI is reshaping global power.<br /><br />Every Monday for the next four weeks, writers from both publications will debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution reshaping global power.

In 2006, Hoare was a 29-year-old computer programmer working for Mozilla. After a software crash broke the elevator in his building, he set about designing a new computer language; one that he hoped would make it possible to write small, fast code without memory bugs.<br /><br />That language developed into Rust, one of the hottest new languages on the planet. But while it isn’t unusual for someone to make a new computer language, it’s incredibly rare for one to take hold and become part of the programming pantheon.
