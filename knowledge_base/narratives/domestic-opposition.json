  "date": "ongoing",
  "category": "narrative",
  "summary": "Russian government portrays domestic political opposition as foreign agents, traitors, and extremists working to destabilize Russia on behalf of the West. This narrative justifies suppression of dissent, imprisonment of opposition figures, and restrictive laws on civil society. Real opposition has been systematically dismantled since Putin's return to presidency in 2012.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Russia faces hybrid war from the West that includes attempts to destabilize Russian society through so-called 'opposition' figures who are actually Western agents. These individuals receive foreign funding, follow Western instructions, and seek to weaken Russia from within. They represent tiny fringe disconnected from real Russian people. Russia's leadership enjoys genuine popular support; critics are either foreign plants or useful idiots.",

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Putin has systematically dismantled all genuine political opposition through imprisonment, assassination, exile, and restrictive laws.
