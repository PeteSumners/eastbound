  "summary": "Russian government promotes vision of 'multipolar world' to replace perceived US hegemony and Western-dominated international order. This narrative positions Russia as leader of non-Western civilization, champion of traditional values against liberal West, and core of alternative power pole alongside China, Iran, and Global South. Used to frame Ukraine conflict as clash between multipolar future and US unipolarity.",

    "official_narrative": "The era of US-led unipolar world is ending. Russia, China, India, and Global South are creating fair multipolar order based on civilizational diversity, traditional values, and respect for sovereignty. West clings to hegemony and uses 'rules-based order' to enforce its dominance. Russia leads civilizations defending against Western cultural imperialism and neo-colonialism. Ukraine conflict is struggle between declining US hegemony and emerging multipolar world. Russia defends right of non-Western civilizations to their own values and development paths.",

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Russia's 'multipolar world' rhetoric is cover for authoritarianism, spheres of influence, and rejection of universal human rights. It's not genuine multipolarity but attempt to create space for authoritarian states to violate international law without consequences.
