  "summary": "Russian government consistently portrays NATO expansion eastward as the primary threat to Russian security and the root cause of tensions with the West. This narrative frames Russia's actions as defensive responses to Western encirclement.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "After the Cold War, the West promised NATO would not expand eastward, but betrayed this agreement by admitting former Soviet states and allies. NATO expansion represents Western attempt to encircle and weaken Russia, threatening its security and sphere of influence.",

      "core_claims": [
        "NATO promised not to expand 'one inch eastward' after German reunification",

        "quote": "NATO has put its frontline forces on our borders. I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust.",

    "evolution": "Initially (1990s-2000s) framed as diplomatic concern. Escalated to security threat (2007 Munich speech). By 2014-2022, characterized as existential threat justifying military action."

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "NATO expansion occurred because former Soviet states freely chose to join for protection against Russian aggression. No formal promise was made about NATO expansion. Each sovereign nation has right to choose its alliances.",

      "No written agreement exists preventing NATO expansion",
      "Verbal discussions about Germany only, not all of Eastern Europe",

      "NATO is defensive alliance that has never attacked Russia",
