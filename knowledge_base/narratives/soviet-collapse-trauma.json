  "summary": "Russian government frames the 1991 Soviet Union collapse as 'greatest geopolitical catastrophe' and source of ongoing national humiliation. This narrative portrays 1990s as decade of chaos, poverty, and Western exploitation. It positions Putin's rule as restoration of Russian greatness and reversal of post-Soviet decline. Ukraine conflict framed as preventing second dismemberment of Russian world.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Soviet collapse was not liberation but tragedy - sudden loss of superpower status, millions of Russians stranded abroad, economic chaos, national humiliation, and Western exploitation of Russian weakness. The 1990s were catastrophic decade when West took advantage of Russia, expanded NATO, and tried to keep Russia weak. Putin has restored Russian strength, dignity, and sovereignty. Current Western pressure is attempt to repeat 1991 collapse and divide Russia. Ukraine is artificial state created by Soviet-era mistakes; preventing its Western integration is existential necessity.",
