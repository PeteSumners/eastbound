  "title": "Wagner Mutiny (June 2023)",
  "date": "2023-06-23",
  "category": "event",
  "summary": "On June 23-24, 2023, Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin led armed rebellion against Russian military leadership. Wagner forces seized Rostov-on-Don (Southern Military District HQ), began march toward Moscow. Putin called it treason and armed mutiny. Crisis resolved after ~36 hours via negotiations with Belarus leader Lukashenko. Prigozhin died in plane crash two months later (August 2023). Event revealed tensions within Russian power structure and vulnerabilities in Putin's system.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Prigozhin and Wagner were deceived and manipulated by enemies of Russia (implied: Western intelligence). This was attempted armed mutiny and treason. However, Wagner fighters (not Prigozhin) were patriots who made a mistake and were given opportunity to return. The situation was resolved peacefully showing Putin's wisdom and strength. Defense Minister Shoigu and Chief of Staff Gerasimov remain in positions, proving military leadership is sound.",
    "media_framing": {
      "terminology": "Armed mutiny, rebellion, betrayal. Carefully avoided calling Prigozhin/Wagner heroes after the fact.",
      "justifications": [
        "Prigozhin was manipulated by foreign intelligence services",
        "Wagner fighters were misled, not traitors themselves",
        "Putin showed strength by resolving without mass bloodshed",
        "Defense leadership vindicated by staying in positions",
        "No fundamental problems in Russian military or government"

      "media_blackout": "During crisis, Russian state media had near-total blackout. Telegram was primary source. After resolution, heavily controlled messaging.",
      "prohibited_narratives": "Cannot acknowledge that mutiny revealed weakness, divisions, or that it nearly succeeded. Cannot suggest Prigozhin had legitimate grievances."

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Mutiny revealed deep problems in Russian military and Putin's control. Exposed tensions between Defense Ministry and Wagner. Showed dissatisfaction with Ukraine war management. Putin appeared weak during crisis - rebels within 200km of Moscow with little opposition. Deal with Prigozhin showed Putin feared confrontation. Prigozhin's death was revenge killing. Event demonstrated fragility of Russian system and potential for instability.",
