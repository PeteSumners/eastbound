  "date": "2014-02-27",
  "category": "event",
  "summary": "Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in February-March 2014, following Euromaidan. Russian forces without insignia ('little green men') took control of the peninsula. Russia held a disputed referendum and formally annexed Crimea on March 18, 2014. Not recognized by international community.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Crimea voluntarily reunified with Russia after a legitimate referendum. Russia was protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers from the 'fascist' Kyiv government.
