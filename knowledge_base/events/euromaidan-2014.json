  "summary": "Mass protests in Ukraine (November 2013 - February 2014) that led to the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia portrays this as Western-backed coup; Ukraine sees it as democratic revolution. This event triggered the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",

  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Euromaidan was a violent, Western-orchestrated coup d'état that illegally overthrew the democratically elected Ukrainian president. The US and EU manipulated Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis to install an anti-Russian puppet government in Kyiv, threatening Russian security and Russian-speaking Ukrainians.",
    "media_framing": {
      "terminology": "Consistently called 'coup' (gosudarstvennyi perevorot), never 'revolution' or 'protests'",
      "core_claims": [
        "Orchestrated by US State Department and CIA",
        "Led by neo-Nazi elements (Right Sector, Svoboda party)",
        "Snipers who killed protesters were hired by opposition, not government",
        "Yanukovych was legitimate president removed illegally",
        "Ethnic Russians and Russian speakers endangered by new government"
      ],
      "evidence_cited": [
        "Victoria Nuland's 'F*** the EU' phone call discussing Ukraine's future government",

      }
    ],
    "evolution": "Initially (2013) portrayed as minority of radicals. After Yanukovych fled (Feb 2014), narrative shifted to full 'coup' framing. By 2022 invasion, Euromaidan became foundational justification for 'denazification' narrative."
  },

  "western_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Euromaidan was a genuine popular uprising demanding closer ties with Europe, fighting corruption, and rejecting authoritarianism. Yanukovych's violent crackdown on peaceful protesters and subsequent flight from Ukraine delegitimized his presidency.",
