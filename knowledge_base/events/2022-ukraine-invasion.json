  "russian_perspective": {
    "official_narrative": "Russia characterizes the invasion as a 'special military operation' necessary to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, protect Russian-speaking populations in Donbas, and prevent NATO expansion eastward. Moscow claims it acted defensively in response to Western aggression and Ukrainian persecution of ethnic Russians.",
    "media_framing": {
      "terminology": "Never called a 'war' or 'invasion' - consistently termed 'special military operation' (spetsoperatsiya)",

        "context": "Justification to international media"
      }
    ],
    "evolution": "Initial narrative focused on quick 'denazification.' After military setbacks, shifted to protecting Donbas, preventing NATO expansion, and resisting Western imperialism. By 2023-2024, framed as existential conflict between Russia and collective West."
