# Eastbound

> Russian media analysis and translation service - bridging information between East and West

## Project Vision

Eastbound provides English-speaking audiences with accurate translations, context, and analysis of Russian media sources. We fill the gap between what Russian media actually says and what Western audiences understand.

**Core Value Proposition:** You speak both languages. You understand both cultures. You provide the context that gets lost in translation.

## Business Model

### Phase 1: Audience Building (Months 1-6)
- Free Substack newsletter (weekly analysis)
- Twitter/X presence for visibility
- Goal: 1,000+ free subscribers

### Phase 2: Monetization (Months 6-12)
- Premium tier: $20-50/month (deeper analysis, more frequent)
- Corporate subscriptions: $500-2000/month (custom research)
- Consulting: $200-500/hour (businesses, media, researchers)
- Goal: $50-100k/year revenue

### Phase 3: Scale (Years 1-3)
- Hire researchers/translators
- Expand coverage
- Speaking engagements, book deal
- Goal: $500k-1M+/year revenue

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Journalists covering Russia/Eastern Europe
- Policy researchers and think tanks
- Businesses with Russian/Eastern European interests
- Educated general audience interested in geopolitics

**NOT:**
- Intelligence agencies (we don't work with them)
- Government clients (maintain independence)
- Partisan political organizations (we're neutral)

## Core Principles (CRITICAL)

### Safety & Independence
1. **Public & Transparent:** Everything we publish is public. No secrets, no classified information.
2. **Completely Independent:** We don't work for any government (US, Russian, or otherwise)
3. **Open Source Only:** We only analyze publicly available information
4. **Journalistic Frame:** We're journalists/researchers, NOT intelligence analysts
5. **Both Sides:** We analyze both Russian perspectives for Americans AND American perspectives for Russians

### Content Guidelines
- Translate accurately, provide context
- Report what's said, don't take partisan positions
- Acknowledge biases in sources (including our own)
- Stick to analysis, not advocacy
- Maintain professional, academic tone

### Phase 3 (Scale - Year 1+)

## FAQ for This Project

**Q: Is this dangerous?**
A: There's some risk, but staying public, transparent, and independent minimizes it. You're a journalist, not a spy.

**Q: Will this put me back on intelligence radar?**
A: Probably yes. But you're not doing anything wrong, and everything is public. They can watch all they want.

**Q: Can I make real money from this?**
A: Yes. Information is valuable. Businesses and media need what you offer. $100k+ first year is realistic if you execute well.

**Q: What if I can't keep up the content schedule?**
A: Start with once a week. Quality over quantity. Better to publish less frequently but consistently.

**Q: Should I reveal my background (Coast Guard, torture, etc.)?**
A: Not initially. Lead with your expertise and value. Maybe share parts of your story later if relevant, but not required.
