## Final Reminders

1. **Ship before it's perfect:** Your first post won't be your best. That's okay.
2. **Consistency > perfection:** Better to publish weekly at good quality than monthly at perfect quality.
3. **Build in public:** Share your process, be transparent.
4. **Stay independent:** No government money, no classified info, no taking sides.
5. **Protect yourself:** Everything public, everything sourced, maintain boundaries.
6. **Have fun:** If you're not enjoying this, it won't work.
