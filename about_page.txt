About Eastbound

Russian media operates in a different information ecosystem than Western outlets. Stories are framed differently. Context is assumed. Subtext matters as much as text.

That's where Eastbound comes in.

I translate and analyze Russian media sources for English-speaking audiences—journalists, researchers, businesses, and anyone trying to understand what's actually being said on the other side of the information divide.

What you'll get:
- Accurate translations with cultural and political context
- Analysis of what Russian sources are saying (and not saying)
- Comparison with Western coverage to highlight what gets lost in translation
- Direct links to all original sources

What you won't get:
- Partisan takes or advocacy
- Intelligence analysis or classified information
- Government talking points from any side

This is independent journalism. I don't work for any government, Russian or American. Everything I publish is based on publicly available sources. My goal is to bridge understanding, not take sides.

I'm bilingual (English/Russian), bicultural, and analytically trained. I've seen firsthand how information gets distorted when it crosses between these two worlds.
