Он решит, являются ли высказывания Крамника в адрес Народицкого, а также чешского гроссмейстера Давида Навары, ранее обвинявшего россиянина в том, что тот довел его до «суицидальных» мыслей, «харассментом» и «унижением достоинства», угрожая применить в отношении 14-го чемпиона мира санкции. Правда, непонятно, как реально FIDE может наказать давно завершившего карьеру выдающегося российского игрока."

Экспортеры активно продавали валюту в условиях ужесточения санкций, компании-импортеры и граждане столь же активно покупали юани — по своим причинам. Эксперты ожидают роста активности на валютном биржевом рынке к концу года в связи с сезонными факторами."

Ford. Таким образом в регионе была сконцентрирована крупнейшая военная группировка США со времен вторжения в Панаму в 1989 году. Президент Дональд Трамп обосновал концентрацию сил в Карибском море борьбой с наркотрафиком из Венесуэлы. В ответ венесуэльский лидер Николас Мадуро обвинил США в искусственном создании кризиса с целью отстранения его от власти и распорядился о массовом развертывании всех имеющихся сил, включая создание партизанских отрядов."
