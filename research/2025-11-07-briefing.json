Выпал из общей тенденции лишь ВТБ (MOEX: VTBR), который демонстрировал резкие колебания объема выдачи, в сентябре впервые с начала года уступив Альфа-банку. Эксперты связывают такую динамику с интеграцией дочерних банков и ограничениями по капиталу."

Обвинение в убийстве было предъявлено гражданину Азербайджана 22-летнему Шахину Аббасову и его брату, но под судом оказались еще несколько их родственников с приятелем, помогавших основным фигурантам скрыться. В итоге приговор для подсудимых оказался очень разным: главные обвиняемые и один их подельник получили внушительные сроки, еще двое — уже отсиженные, а отец Аббасова был оправдан."

И парадоксальным образом приучал зрителя к мысли, что наша культура не обязана быть литературоцентричной. Рассказывает Ксения Воротынцева."

В любом случае, в Москве ранее дали понять, что поступать аналогичным образом по отношению к гражданам ЕС не будут.
