Ближе к концу срока лицензионного договора завод платить отказался, а позднее патент и вовсе был аннулирован, причем с даты подачи заявки на его регистрацию. По этой причине арбитражные суды отклонили иск о взыскании долга по роялти, однако ВС заинтересовали доводы правообладателя, заявляющего о необходимости платы за пользование патентом до его отмены."
