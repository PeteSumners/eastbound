ТО сегодня обязателен для легковых такси, автобусов и грузовиков — большая часть машин ездит без подтверждающих проверку документов. Операторы техосмотра предложение поддержали. Фиксация этого нарушения может начаться, по данным “Ъ”, в конце 2026 года. Представители отрасли такси к новому виду контроля отнеслись скептически: они утверждают, что перевозчики уже сейчас достаточно эффективно контролируют состояние парка.",

      "summary": "Украину захлестнул мощный коррупционный скандал. Две антикоррупционные структуры, полномочия которых украинский лидер Владимир Зеленский летом безуспешно пытался ограничить, обнародовали доказательства махинаций в энергетической отрасли людей из ближайшего окружения президента. Это возбудило подозрения в возможной причастности к коррупции самого Зеленского. Правда, президент попытался дистанцироваться от скандала, отдав распоряжение наказать всех виновных в хищении государственных средств. При этом многое указывает на то, что нынешние разоблачения — лишь верхушка айсберга: схожие коррупционные схемы на Украине практикуются повсеместно, в том числе и в сфере обороны. Украинский скандал прокомментировали на Западе и в Кремле.",

На этой неделе болгарские власти взяли под контроль всю инфраструктуру ЛУКОЙЛа, введя жесткие меры безопасности с привлечением армии и спецслужб. Источники в правительстве предупреждают, что протесты из-за нехватки бензина могут привести к острому политическому кризису, падению кабинета министров и усилению позиций пророссийских сил. В этой ситуации власти надеются договориться с США об отсрочке санкций, как это сделала Венгрия, за что Болгарии также придется пойти на серьезные уступки.
