Главным бенефициаром встречи стал венгерский лидер, противопоставивший себя «либеральной Европе» и добившийся исключения Венгрии из российских нефтяных санкций. Вторым ключевым итогом стало возвращение идеи саммита лидеров России и США в Будапеште и готовность президента Трампа прислушиваться к Виктору Орбану, который, по словам главы Белого дома, «хорошо знает Путина»."
