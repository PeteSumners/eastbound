Рыночная «оцифровка» процессов и «естественная» конкуренция поставщиков за госзакупки малого объема выглядят более перспективными, чем попытки Минфина создать полный каталог закупок для стимулирования такой борьбы «внутри» системы госзаказа. Это подтверждает и опыт московского портала для поставщиков, работающего в формате электронного магазина. В Минфине, впрочем, возможность интеграции маркетплейсов в систему госзакупок не отрицают — она предусмотрена концепцией по совершенствованию закупок малого объема."

На короткой дистанции рост вложений в ответ на тарифные барьеры действительно фиксируется — опасаясь пошлин, некоторые компании стремятся как можно быстрее перенести производства в повышающую их страну. Среднесрочно же возникающий высокий уровень неопределенности в такой экономике подрывает доверие инвесторов. Особенно заметно, по оценкам экономистов, сокращаются вложения в обрабатывающую промышленность: высокие тарифы сказываются на стоимости промежуточных товаров и, как следствие, снижают привлекательность инвестиций."

В ведомстве уточнили, что среди циркулирующих штаммов доминирует грипп A (H3N2).  Одновременно с этим заболеваемость COVID-19 за неделю с 3 по 9 ноября в России снизилась на 22,2%, всего было выявлено 5,6 тыс. случаев.  По данным Роспотребнадзора, на данный момент 59,4 млн россиян сделали прививку от гриппа, что составляет 40,3% населения страны. Вакцинация против гриппа в России стартовала 4 сентября. В этом году, сообщала глава Роспотребнадзора Анна Попова, планируется охватить до 60% населения и не менее 75% россиян, находящихся в группах риска. Для кампании было закуплено более 70 млн доз вакцин, большая часть из них — квадривалентные, то есть защищающие от четырех видов гриппа (двух вирусов типа А и двух типа В).  Полина Мотызлевская"

Переломную роль в этом сыграла группа из семи демократов-центристов, которые вопреки позиции партийного руководства поддержали республиканский законопроект о финансировании. В то время как республиканцы празднуют тактическую победу, в стане демократов углубляется раскол, что уже привело к призывам поменять руководство партии."

Причиной слабой конкуренции могут быть не устроившие инвесторов ценовые параметры, финансовые проблемы генерирующих компаний и низкая цена конкурентного отбора мощности (КОМ), не обеспечивающая приток инвестиций, считают аналитики."
