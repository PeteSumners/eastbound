# Welcome to Eastbound Reports

## What We're Building

Eastbound Reports is a new independent platform dedicated to translating and analyzing Russian media for English-speaking audiences. In an increasingly polarized information environment, we believe there's value in understanding multiple perspectives—not to validate them, but to navigate them intelligently.

## Why This Matters

When it comes to Russia, Western audiences often face a choice between two extremes: complete dismissal of Russian perspectives or uncritical acceptance of Kremlin narratives. We're taking a different approach.

Our mission is simple:
- Provide accurate translations of Russian media sources
- Offer cultural and political context that Western audiences typically miss
- Compare Russian narratives with Western coverage objectively
- Help readers make informed judgments about international events

**Key Principles:**
- **Complete Independence:** No government funding, no intelligence affiliations, no corporate sponsors
- **Transparency:** Everything we do is open source and publicly documented
- **Objectivity:** We report what Russian media says without endorsing or condemning
- **Public Information Only:** We only analyze publicly available sources

## What Makes Us Different

### 1. Open Source Everything

This entire platform—from the automation system to the content templates—is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/PeteSumners/eastbound). You can see exactly how we work, fork the project, or contribute improvements.

### 2. Fully Automated Publishing

We've built a complete publishing system that runs on GitHub Actions:
- Create drafts with templates
- Schedule posts for automatic publication
- Website updates automatically
- Twitter threads generate from content
- All at zero cost

### 3. Independent Platform

Unlike Substack or Medium, we host everything ourselves on GitHub Pages. No platform can shut us down, change their terms, or monetize our audience without permission.

## Content Types

### Weekly Analysis Posts
Deep dives into significant Russian media stories, covering:
- What happened and why it matters
- Russian perspectives from multiple sources (TASS, RIA Novosti, Kommersant, etc.)
- Context that Western audiences miss
- Comparison with Western coverage
- Implications for policy, business, and culture

### Translation Posts
Full translations of important Russian articles, speeches, or statements, with:
- Accurate translation preserving tone and context
- Cultural and linguistic notes
- Analysis of what the piece reveals
- Proper source citations

## Our Sources

We analyze publicly available content from:
- **Major News:** TASS, RIA Novosti, Interfax, RT
- **Business Media:** Kommersant, Vedomosti, RBC
- **Analysis:** Carnegie Moscow, various Telegram channels
- **Government:** Kremlin.ru, MID Russia, Duma statements

All sources are cited with links to the original Russian content.

## What We're Not

Let's be clear about what this project **is not**:

- **Not intelligence work:** We're journalists and researchers, not intelligence analysts
- **Not propaganda:** We don't endorse Russian narratives—we explain them
- **Not partisan:** We're not taking sides in US domestic politics or international conflicts
- **Not classified:** Everything we analyze is publicly available

## The Tech Stack

For those interested in the technical side, this platform runs on:
- Jekyll static site generator
- GitHub Pages for hosting (free)
- GitHub Actions for automation
- Twitter API for social distribution
- Markdown for content
- All code is Python and Ruby

**Total cost: $0/month**

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks and months, we'll be publishing:
- Weekly analysis of major Russian media stories
- Translations of significant Russian articles and statements
- Comparative coverage of how Russian vs. Western media frame major events
- Context explainers on Russian politics, culture, and media landscape

## Get Involved

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions:

- **Follow us on Twitter:** [@eastboundreport](https://twitter.com/eastboundreport)
- **Star the repo:** [github.com/PeteSumners/eastbound](https://github.com/PeteSumners/eastbound)
- **Subscribe via RSS:** [Feed](https://petesumners.github.io/eastbound/feed.xml)
- **Fork the project:** Use this system for your own analysis
- **Contribute:** Suggest stories, report issues, improve the code

## Bottom Line

In a world of information warfare, the best defense is understanding. Eastbound Reports exists to help English-speaking audiences understand what Russian media is saying, why they're saying it, and how it differs from Western narratives.

We're not asking you to believe Russian media. We're asking you to understand it.

Welcome aboard.
